      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research centers on both theoretical and experimental studies of narrow-linewidth stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) â€” a unique nonlinear optical process involving the coupling of optical fields with low-frequency, long-lived traveling acoustic waves in photonic waveguides. Specifically, I focus on a special class of SBS known as **FIM-FAM**, short for **F**orward **I**nter-**M**odal Brillouin interactions with **F**undamental **A**coustic **M**odes. I work with a variety of photonic waveguides, including specialty optical fibers, fiber tapers, and integrated photonic waveguides. By leveraging these waveguides as photonic processors, I also model, implement, and characterize **high-performance microwave photonic filters** designed to manipulate and process microwave signals with exceptional frequency precision.

        I am seeking technical job opportunities in industry where I can apply my research and problem-solving skills to contribute to innovative projects. I welcome the chance to connect and explore potential oppotunities. ðŸ˜ƒ
