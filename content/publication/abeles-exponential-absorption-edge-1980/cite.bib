 abstract = {Optical and photoelectric measurements demonstrate that hydrogenated amorphous silicon prepared by glow discharge decomposition of silane has an exponential optical absorption edge, over the photon energy range 1.4--1.8 eV with a slope of 0.05--0.08 eV. Evidence is presented that the photogeneration efficiency is unity at room temperature and independent of electric field (102-104 V/cm-1) and photon energy (1.2--2.2 eV).},
