abstract: Supercontinuum (SC) generation based on ultrashort pulse compression constitutes
  one of the most promising technologies towards an ultra-wide bandwidth, high-brightness
  and spatially coherent light sources for applications such as spectroscopy and microscopy.
  Here, multi-octave SC generation in a gas-filled hollow-core antiresonant fiber
  (HC-ARF) is reported spanning from 200 nm in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) to 4000
  nm in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). A measured average output power of 5 mW was obtained
  by pumping at the center wavelength of the first anti-resonance transmission window
  (2460 nm) with ~100 fs pulses and an injected pulse energy of ~7-8 muJ. The mechanism
  behind the extreme spectral broadening relies upon intense soliton-plasma nonlinear
  dynamics which leads to efficient soliton self-compression and phase-matched dispersive
  wave (DW) emission in the DUV region. The strongest DW is observed at 275 nm having
  an estimated pulse energy of 1.42 muJ, corresponding to 28.4 % of the total output
  energy. Furthermore, the effect of changing the pump pulse energy and gas pressure
  on the nonlinear dynamics and their direct impact on SC generation was investigated.
  The current work paves a new way towards novel investigations of gas-based ultrafast
  nonlinear optics in the emerging mid-IR spectral regime.
