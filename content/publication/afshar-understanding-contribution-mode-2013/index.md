abstract: We resolve the ambiguity in existing definitions of the effective area of
  a waveguide mode that have been reported in the literature by examining which definition
  leads to an accurate evaluation of the effective Kerr nonlinearity. We show that
  the effective nonlinear coefficient of a waveguide mode can be written as the product
  of a suitable average of the nonlinear coefficients of the waveguide's constituent
  materials, the mode's group velocity and a new suitably defined effective mode area.
  None of these parameters on their own completely describe the strength of the nonlinear
  effects of a waveguide.
