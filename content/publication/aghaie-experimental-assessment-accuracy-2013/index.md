abstract: From scanning-electron microscope images of the cross section of a photonic-bandgap
  fiber (NKT Photonics' HC-1550-02) we developed a realistic model for its permittivity
  profile that includes all observable structural deformations in the core and in
  the first two rows of cladding holes. Using this more accurate index profile in
  our C++ full-vectorial finite-difference mode solver, we numerically studied this
  fiber's modal dispersion, along with the intensity profile, group index spectrum,
  and group-velocity dispersion spectrum of its fundamental mode. Comparisons between
  these predictions and their experimental counterparts measured in the fiber show
  good quantitative agreement for all these characteristics. On the other hand, when
  these structural deformations are purposely not included in the permittivity profile,
  the predicted and measured characteristics generally poorly match. The study demonstrates
  that first, accurate simultaneous predictions of several key modal characteristics
  of hollow-core fibers can be obtained numerically, and that although small, the
  aforementioned index-profile perturbations must be included in order to obtain sufficient
  accuracy.
