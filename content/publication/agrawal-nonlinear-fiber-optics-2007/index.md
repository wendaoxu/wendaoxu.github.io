abstract: Since the 3rd edition appeared, a fast evolution of the field has occurred.
  The fourth edition of this classic work provides an up-to-date account of the nonlinear
  phenomena occurring inside optical fibers. The contents include such important topics
  as self- and cross-phase modulation, stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering,
  four-wave mixing, modulation instability, and optical solitons. Many new figures
  have been added to help illustrate the concepts discussed in the book.New to this
  edition are chapters on highly nonlinear fibers and and the novel nonlinear effects
  that have been observed in these fibers since 2000. Such a chapter should be of
  interest to people in the field of new wavelengths generation, which has potential
  application in medical diagnosis and treatments, spectroscopy, new wavelength lasers
  and light sources, etc. Continues to be industry bestseller providing unique source
  of comprehensive coverage on the subject of nonlinear fiber optics Fourth Edition
  is a completely up-to-date treatment of the nonlinear phenomena occurring inside
  optical fibers Includes 2 NEW CHAPTERS on the properties of highly nonlinear fibers
  and their novel nonlinear effects
