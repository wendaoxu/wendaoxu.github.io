abstract: We present polymer (PMMA) cladded chalcogenide (As2Se3) hybrid microwires
  that realize optical parametric four-wave mixing (FWM) with wavelength conversion
  bandwidth as broad as 190 nm and efficiency as high as 21 dB at peak input power
  levels as low as 70 mW. This represents 3-30 Ã— increase in bandwidth and 30-50 dB
  improvement in conversion efficiency over previous demonstrations in tapered and
  microstructured chalcogenide fibers with the results agreeing well with the simulations.
  These properties, combined with small foot-print (10 cm length), low loss (&lt;4
  dB), ease of fabrication, and the transparency of As2Se3 from near-to-mid-infrared
  regions make this device a promising building block for lasers, optical instrumentation
  and optical communication devices.
