abstract: This paper presents an octagonal photonic crystal fiber (O-PCF) for liquid
  sensing, in which both core and cladding are microstructured. Some propagation characteristics
  of proposed structure have been investigated by using the full vectorial finite
  element method (FEM). Confinement loss and sensitivity are examined and compared
  with varying number of rings, core diameter, diameter of air holes in cladding ring
  and pitch. It is found that sensitivity is increased for the increment pitch value,
  air filling ratio, core diameter, inner ring diameter as well as number of rings.
  At the same time confinement loss is significantly decreased. It is also found that
  the increment of pitch by keeping the same air filling ratio increases the sensitivity
  and loss. Investigating the effects of different parameters, an O-PCF structure
  is designed which has a significantly higher relative sensitivity and lower confinement
  loss.
