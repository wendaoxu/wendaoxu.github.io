abstract: The analysis of chemical species is one of the most fundamental and long-standing
  challenges in fiber-optic sensors research. Existing sensor architectures require
  a spatial overlap between light and the substance being tested and rely either on
  structural modifications of standard fibers or on specialty photonic crystal fibers.
  In this work, we report an optomechanical fiber sensor that addresses liquids outside
  the cladding of standard, 8/125 $Î¼$m single-mode fibers with no structural intervention.
  Measurements are based on forward stimulated Brillouin scattering by radial, guided
  acoustic modes of the fiber structure. The acoustic modes are stimulated by an optical
  pump pulse and probed by an optical signal wave, both confined to the core. The
  acoustic vibrations induce a nonreciprocal phase delay to the signal wave, which
  is monitored in a Sagnac interferometer loop configuration. The measured resonance
  frequencies and excitation strengths of individual modes agree with the predictions
  of a corresponding quantitative analysis. The acoustic reflectivity at the outer
  cladding boundary and the acoustic impedance of the surrounding medium are extracted
  from cavity lifetime measurements of multiple modes. The acoustic impedances of
  deionized water and ethanol are measured with better than 1% accuracy. The measurements
  successfully distinguish between aqueous solutions with 0, 4%, 8%, and 12% concentrations
  of dissolved salt. The new fiber-sensing paradigm might be used in the monitoring
  of industrial processes involving ionic solutions.
