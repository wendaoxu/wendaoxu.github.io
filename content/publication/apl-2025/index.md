abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering is a well-known nonlinear optical interaction
  valued for applications including narrow-linewidth lasers, phase conjugation, sensing,
  and RF-signal processing such as delay lines and filters. While interaction strength
  and linewidth directly affect device performance, most strongly interacting Brillouin
  systems have linewidths of many MHz, limited by the high frequency of the participating
  acoustic waves. By engineering Forward Inter-Modal Brillouin interactions to access
  the Fundamental Acoustic Modes (FIM-FAM), strong Brillouin coupling can be extended
  over a wide frequency range, including lower frequencies that support significantly
  narrower linewidths. In this work, sub-MHz Brillouin linewidths as narrow as 110Â kHz
  are observed in tapered optical fibers with homogeneous waists. Tight confinement
  of both the optical and acoustic waves yields Brillouin gains over a thousand times
  higher than traditional backward Brillouin scattering in standard fibers, and a
  long waist and low-loss transitions enable a Brillouin interaction strength nearly
  a hundred times greater than prior taper-based FIM-FAM demonstrations. A specific
  radius and comprehensive polarization control suppress background scattering by
  over 40 dB relative to the signal. A comprehensive theoretical model is developed
  accounting for the dynamical behavior of optical and acoustic waves, reproducing
  qualitative behavior for several experimental configurations. In addition, the dependence
  of homogeneity of the linewidth is investigated and reveals a route toward further
  linewidth reduction by controlling phase-matched frequency variations throughout
  the waist. Extending strongly coupled Brillouin interactions to ultranarrow linewidths
  with a recipe for fabrication, detailed characterization techniques, and a comprehensive
  theoretical treatment will benefit high-performance Brillouin-based photonic applications.
