abstract: The field of cavity optomechanics is reviewed. This field explores the interaction
  between electromagnetic radiation and nanomechanical or micromechanical motion.
  This review covers the basics of optical cavities and mechanical resonators, their
  mutual optomechanical interaction mediated by the radiation-pressure force, the
  large variety of experimental systems which exhibit this interaction, optical measurements
  of mechanical motion, dynamical backaction amplification and cooling, nonlinear
  dynamics, multimode optomechanics, and proposals for future cavity-quantum-optomechanics
  experiments. In addition, the perspectives for fundamental quantum physics and for
  possible applications of optomechanical devices are described.
