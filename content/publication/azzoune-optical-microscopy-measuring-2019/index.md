abstract: We describe a technique that allows the improvement of the resolution of
  optical microscopes for nanofiber measurements beyond the diffraction limit. It
  can be readily implemented on any microscope. We demonstrated it by measuring tapered
  fibers radii from 0.4 to 4 &#x00B5;m with a resolution below the diffraction limit,
  from a few nanometers up to 50 nm in the worst case, depending on the radii. This
  technique is a non-contact measurement with the microscope objective placed a few
  centimeters from the nanofiber. We acquire the experimental diffraction pattern
  by scanning the object plane of the microscope system, upstream and downstream the
  nanofiber. We compare this experimental diffraction pattern to a bank of all the
  simulated patterns for all the radii. The radius of the simulated diffraction pattern
  that best matches to the experimental one is the sought radius.
