abstract: In this paper we present a novel method to reliably strip the unwanted cladding
  light in high-power fiber lasers. Soft metals are utilized to fabricate a high-power
  cladding light stripper (CLS). The capability of indium (In), aluminum (Al), tin
  (Sn), and gold (Au) in extracting unwanted cladding light is examined. The experiments
  show that these metals have the right features for stripping the unwanted light
  out of the cladding. We also find that the metal&#x2013;cladding contact area is
  of great importance because it determines the attenuation and the thermal load on
  the CLS. These metals are examined in different forms to optimize the contact area
  to have the highest possible attenuation and avoid localized heating. The results
  show that sheets of indium are very effective in stripping unwanted cladding light.
