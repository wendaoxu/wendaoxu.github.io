 abstract = {We present a generalized heat-brush tapering approach in which the ratio of the feed and draw velocities changes within each tapering sweep. This approach allows for controlled and precise shaping of tapers with an arbitrary waist profile and dissimilar transition regions as demonstrated experimentally. A quantitative analysis of the mismatch error after each tapering sweep is also provided.},
