abstract: We present a generalized heat-brush tapering approach in which the ratio
  of the feed and draw velocities changes within each tapering sweep. This approach
  allows for controlled and precise shaping of tapers with an arbitrary waist profile
  and dissimilar transition regions as demonstrated experimentally. A quantitative
  analysis of the mismatch error after each tapering sweep is also provided.
