abstract: 'We investigate experimentally the optical tunneling times associated with
  frustrated total internal reflection of a light beam. Using as physical clocks the
  lateral shifts and angular deviations suffered by the transmitted and reflected
  beams, we measure both components of a complex tunneling time: the phase time and
  a semiclassical time. The phase time is shown to imply superluminal velocities and
  to depend strongly on boundary conditions not linked to the tunneling process. By
  contrast, the semiclassical time yields subluminal velocities and is related solely
  to tunneling.'
