abstract: Brillouin scattering in optical fiber describes the interaction of an electro-magnetic
  field (photon) with a characteristic density variation of the fiber. When the electric
  field amplitude of an optical beam (so-called pump wave), and another wave is introduced
  at the downshifted Brillouin frequency (namely Stokes wave), the beating between
  the pump and Stokes waves creates a modified density change via the electrostriction
  effect, resulting in so-called the stimulated Brillouin scattering. The density
  variation is associated with a mechanical acoustic wave; and it may be affected
  by local temperature, strain, and vibration which induce changes in the fiber effective
  refractive index and sound velocity. Through the measurement of the static or dynamic
  changes in Brillouin frequency along the fiber one can realize a distributed fiber
  sensor for local temperature, strain and vibration over tens or hundreds of kilometers.
  This paper reviews the progress on improving sensing performance parameters like
  spatial resolution, sensing length limitation and simultaneous temperature and strain
  measurement. These kinds of sensors can be used in civil structural monitoring of
  pipelines, bridges, dams, and railroads for disaster prevention. Analogous to the
  static Bragg grating, one can write a moving Brillouin grating in fibers, with the
  lifetime of the acoustic wave. The length of the Brillouin grating can be controlled
  by the writing pulses at any position in fibers. Such gratings can be used to measure
  changes in birefringence, which is an important parameter in fiber communications.
  Applications for this kind of sensor can be found in aerospace, material processing
  and fine structures. oÌ§pyright 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.
