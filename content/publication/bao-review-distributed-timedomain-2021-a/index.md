abstract: Distributed time-domain Brillouin scattering fiber sensors have been widely
  used to measure the changes of the temperature and strain. The linear dependence
  of the temperature and strain on the Brillouin frequency shift enabled the distributed
  temperature and strain sensing based on mapping of the Brillouin gain spectrum.
  In addition, an acoustic wave can be detected by the four wave mixing (FWM) associated
  SBS process, in which phase matching condition is satisfied via up-down conversion
  of SBS process through birefringence matching before and after the conversion process.
  Brillouin scattering can be considered as the scattering of a pump wave from a moving
  grating (acoustic phonon) which induces a Doppler frequency shift in the resulting
  Stokes wave. The frequency shift is dependent on many factors including the velocity
  of sound in the scattering medium as well as the index of refraction. Such a process
  can be used to monitor the gain of random fiber laser based on SBS, the distributed
  acoustic wave reflect the distributed SBS gain for random lasing radiation, as well
  as the relative intensity noise inside the laser gain medium. In this review paper,
  the distributed time-domain sensing system based on Brillouin scattering including
  Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR), Brillouin optical time-domain
  analysis (BOTDA), and FWM enhanced SBS for acoustic wave detection are introduced
  for their working principles and recent progress. The distributed Brillouin sensors
  based on specialty fibers for simultaneous temperature and strain measurement are
  summarized. Applications for the Brillouin scattering time-domain sensors are briefly
  discussed.
