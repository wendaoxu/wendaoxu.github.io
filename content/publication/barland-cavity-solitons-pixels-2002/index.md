abstract: Cavity solitons are localized intensity peaks that can form in a homogeneous
  background of radiation. They are generated by shining laser pulses into optical
  cavities that contain a nonlinear medium driven by a coherent field (holding beam).
  The ability to switch cavity solitons on and off1,2 and to control their location
  and motion3 by applying laser pulses makes them interesting as potential `pixels'
  for reconfigurable arrays or all-optical processing units. Theoretical work on cavity
  solitons2,3,4,5,6,7 has stimulated a variety of experiments in macroscopic cavities8,9,10
  and in systems with optical feedback11,12,13. But for practical devices, it is desirable
  to generate cavity solitons in semiconductor structures, which would allow fast
  response and miniaturization. The existence of cavity solitons in semiconductor
  microcavities has been predicted theoretically14,15,16,17, and precursors of cavity
  solitons have been observed, but clear experimental realization has been hindered
  by boundary-dependence of the resulting optical patterns18,19---cavity solitons
  should be self-confined. Here we demonstrate the generation of cavity solitons in
  vertical cavity semiconductor microresonators that are electrically pumped above
  transparency but slightly below lasing threshold20. We show that the generated optical
  spots can be written, erased and manipulated as objects independent of each other
  and of the boundary. Numerical simulations allow for a clearer interpretation of
  experimental results.
