 abstract = {A new birefringence measurement technique for single-mode optical fibers using a photo-elastic birefringence modulator is described. The method is compared to an existing static measurement method to illustrate the sensitivity, accuracy, and speed made available. Experimental results on both low- and high-birefringence fibers are presented.},
