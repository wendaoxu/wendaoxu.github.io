abstract: A new birefringence measurement technique for single-mode optical fibers
  using a photo-elastic birefringence modulator is described. The method is compared
  to an existing static measurement method to illustrate the sensitivity, accuracy,
  and speed made available. Experimental results on both low- and high-birefringence
  fibers are presented.
