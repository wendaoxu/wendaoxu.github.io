abstract: Opto-mechanical interactions in guided wave media are drawing great interest
  in fundamental research and applications. Forward stimulated Brillouin scattering,
  in particular, is widely investigated in optical fibres and photonic integrated
  circuits. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of forward stimulated Brillouin
  scattering over standard, panda-type polarization maintaining fibres. We distinguish
  between intra-polarization scattering, in which two pump tones are co-polarized
  along one principal axis, and inter-polarization processes driven by orthogonally
  polarized pump waves. Both processes are quantified in analysis, calculations and
  experiment. Inter-modal scattering, in particular, introduces cross-polarization
  switching of probe waves that is non-reciprocal. Switching takes place in multiple
  wavelength windows. The results provide a first demonstration of opto-mechanical
  non-reciprocity of forward scatter in standard fibre. The inter-polarization process
  is applicable to distributed sensors of media outside the cladding and coating boundaries,
  where light cannot reach. The process may be scaled towards forward Brillouin lasers,
  optical isolators and circulators and narrowband microwave-photonic filters over
  longer sections of off-the-shelf polarization maintaining fibres.
