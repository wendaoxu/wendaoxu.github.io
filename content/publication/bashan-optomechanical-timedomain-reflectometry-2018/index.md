abstract: 'Optical fibres constitute an exceptional sensing platform. However, standard
  fibres present an inherent sensing challenge: they confine light to an inner core.
  Consequently, distributed fibre sensors are restricted to the measurement of conditions
  that prevail within the core. This work presents distributed analysis of media outside
  unmodified, standard fibre. Measurements are based on stimulated scattering by guided
  acoustic modes, which allow us to listen where we cannot look. The protocol overcomes
  a major difficulty: guided acoustic waves induce forward scattering, which cannot
  be mapped using time-of-flight. The solution relies on mapping the Rayleigh backscatter
  contributions of two optical tones, which are coupled by the acoustic wave. Analysis
  is demonstrated over 3,km of fibre with 100,m resolution. Measurements distinguish
  between air, ethanol and water outside the cladding, and between air and water outside
  polyimide-coated fibres. The results establish a new sensor configuration: optomechanical
  time-domain reflectometry, with several potential applications.'
