abstract: 'We review the optical guidance properties of hollow-core photonic crystal
  fibers. We follow a historical perspective to introduce the two major optical guidance
  mechanisms that were identified as operating in these fibers: photonic bandgap guidance
  and inhibited coupling guidance. We then review the modal properties of these fibers
  and assess the transmission loss mechanisms in photonic bandgap guiding hollow-core
  photonic crystal fiber. We dedicate a section to a review of the technical basics
  of hollow-core photonic crystal fiber fabrication and photonic microcell assembly.
  We review some of the early results on the use of hollow-core photonic crystal fiber
  for laser guiding micro-sized particles, as well as the generation of stimulated
  Raman scattering, electromagnetically induced transparency and laser frequency stabilization
  when the fiber core is filled with a gas-phase material. We conclude this review
  with a non-exhaustive list of prospects where hollow-core photonic crystal fiber
  could play a central role.'
