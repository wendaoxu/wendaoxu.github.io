 abstract = {We review the progress made on the fabrication and applications of hollow-core photonic crystal fibres (HC-PCFs). The mechanism of the light guidance in these fibres is described along with their dispersion properties. We review the HC-PCF fabrication, the different results achieved in the fields of laser-induced particle guidance, low-threshold stimulated Raman scattering in hydrogen (vibrational and rotational), laser frequency metrology and quantum optics. Finally, we show the different new prospects opened up by these fibres.},
