abstract: We review the progress made on the fabrication and applications of hollow-core
  photonic crystal fibres (HC-PCFs). The mechanism of the light guidance in these
  fibres is described along with their dispersion properties. We review the HC-PCF
  fabrication, the different results achieved in the fields of laser-induced particle
  guidance, low-threshold stimulated Raman scattering in hydrogen (vibrational and
  rotational), laser frequency metrology and quantum optics. Finally, we show the
  different new prospects opened up by these fibres.
