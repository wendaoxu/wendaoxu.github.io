 abstract = {Use of a compact form of the general solution of the first-order linear differential equation allows establishing a direct connection with the Green's function method, providing an interesting interpretation of the result. This interpretation is valid for a wide range of physical and chemical problems. o̧pyright 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},
