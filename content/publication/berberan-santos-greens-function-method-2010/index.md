abstract: Use of a compact form of the general solution of the first-order linear
  differential equation allows establishing a direct connection with the Green's function
  method, providing an interesting interpretation of the result. This interpretation
  is valid for a wide range of physical and chemical problems. o̧pyright 2010 Springer
