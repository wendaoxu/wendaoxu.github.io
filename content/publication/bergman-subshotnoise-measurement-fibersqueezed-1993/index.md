abstract: A novel scheme employing two pulses separated by a short time delay is used
  to cancel the phase noise from guided-acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering in a fiber
  ring interferometer. The dual-pulse-excited fiber ring is used to generate squeezed
  vacuum that, when injected into a measuring Mach--Zehnder interferometer, improves
  its sensitivity by 3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit.
