abstract: Brillouin scattering in optical fibres is a fundamental interaction between
  light and sound with important implications ranging from optical sensors to slow
  and fast light. In usual optical fibres, light both excites and feels shear and
  longitudinal bulk elastic waves, giving rise to forward-guided acoustic wave Brillouin
  scattering and backward-stimulated Brillouin scattering. In a subwavelength-diameter
  optical fibre, the situation changes dramatically, as we here report with the first
  experimental observation of Brillouin light scattering from surface acoustic waves.
  These Rayleigh-type surface waves travel the wire surface at a specific velocity
  of 3,400,m,s-1 and backscatter the light with a Doppler shift of about 6,GHz. As
  these acoustic resonances are sensitive to surface defects or features, surface
  acoustic wave Brillouin scattering opens new opportunities for various sensing applications,
  but also in other domains such as microwave photonics and nonlinear plasmonics.
