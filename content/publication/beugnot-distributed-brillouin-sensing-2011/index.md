abstract: A general analytic solution for Brillouin distributed sensing in optical
  fibers with sub-meter spatial resolution is obtained by solving the acoustical-optical
  coupled wave equations by a perturbation method. The Brillouin interaction of a
  triad of square pump pulses with a continuous signal is described, covering a wide
  range of pumping schemes. The model predicts how the acoustic wave, the signal amplitude
  and the optical gain spectral profile depend upon the pumping scheme. Sub-meter
  spatial resolution is demonstrated for bright-, dark- and $π$-shifted interrogating
  pump pulses, together with disturbing echo effects, and the results compare favorably
  with experimental data. This analytic solution is an excellent tool not only for
  optimizing the pumping scheme but also for post-processing the measured data to
  remove resolution degrading features.
