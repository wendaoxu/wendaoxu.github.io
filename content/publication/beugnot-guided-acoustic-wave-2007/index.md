abstract: We experimentally investigate guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering
  in several photonic crystal fibers by use of the so-called fiber loop mirror technique
  and show a completely different dynamics with respect to standard all-silica fibers.
  In addition to the suppression of most acoustic phonons, we show that forward Brillouin
  scattering in photonic crystal fibers is substantially enhanced only for the fundamental
  acoustic phonon because of efficient transverse acousto-optic field overlap. The
  results of our numerical simulations reveal that this high-frequency phonon is indeed
  trapped within the fiber core by the air-hole microstructure, in good agreement
  with experimental measurements.
