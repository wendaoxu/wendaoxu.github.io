abstract: Stylus-profiling techniques cannot be used for surface characterization
  of polymeric surfaces, such as magnetic tapes, because of their relatively low hardness.
  An interferometric-optical-profiling microscope system was used to obtain high-accuracy
  surface profiles of magnetic media, rapidly and without physical contact with the
  sample. The profilometer consists of a conventional, reflection-type optical microscope
  with a Mirau two-beam interferometer attachment. The interference patterns of the
  surface can be observed through the eyepieces and can be detected with a solid-state
  linear array of 1024 detector elements. By translating the reference surface of
  the interferometer with a piezoelectric transducer while taking consecutive measurements,
  accurate surface-height measurements can be obtained from each detector element.
  The microscope system is controlled by a microcomputer, which communicates with
  a desk-top computer for further analysis of the surface-profile data. A computer-controlled
  specimen stage is added to increase the sample size. The reasons for selecting the
  Mirau two-beam interferometry are also discussed. Sample data of magnetic tapes
  are presented. Experimental data presented in the paper show that optimization of
  surface roughness is necessary to obtain optimum magnetic amplitude, friction, and
  wear properties.
