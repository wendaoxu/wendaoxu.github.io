abstract: We demonstrated an all-fiber birefringent comb filter with tunable and switchable
  wavelength spacing. The comb filter is based on a fiber loop mirror (FLM) with three
  sections of high-birefringence (HB) fibers and polarization controllers (PCs). The
  transmission characteristics of the birefringent FLM are dependent of the relative
  phase difference of the two orthogonal polarization modes and the rotational angles
  of the different HB fibers. By adjusting the PCs, four different wavelength spacings
  can be obtained; particularly, interleaving operation---halved and quartered wavelength
  spacing---can be effectively realized. By using a Jones matrix method, the transmission
  of the birefringent comb filter is analyzed. The theoretical analysis agrees with
  the experimental results. oÌ§pyright 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microwave Opt Technol
