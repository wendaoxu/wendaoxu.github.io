 abstract = {The first accurate measurements of the algebraic values of the photoelastic tensor of silicon are reported. The values, determined acousto-optically, are p1111=-0.094, p1122=+0.017, and p1212=-0.051. The results are in strong disagreement with calculations based on the Phillips-Van Vechten theory of ionicity. It is shown that the widely used assumption of a universal power law describing both the intermaterial and intramaterial variations of the homopolar average energy gap with volume must be reinterpreted or revised.},
