 abstract = {All-fiber acousto-optic devices based on the null fused taper coupler have been successfully demonstrated as frequency shifters, variable splitters, switches and tunable filters. In this paper, the interaction upon which these devices are based has been extensively analyzed under a set of approximations that are valid in most cases. Simple analytical expressions for the important properties are derived, which provide a set of design rules for such devices.},
