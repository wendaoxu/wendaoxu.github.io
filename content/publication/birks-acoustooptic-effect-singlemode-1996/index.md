abstract: All-fiber acousto-optic devices based on the null fused taper coupler have
  been successfully demonstrated as frequency shifters, variable splitters, switches
  and tunable filters. In this paper, the interaction upon which these devices are
  based has been extensively analyzed under a set of approximations that are valid
  in most cases. Simple analytical expressions for the important properties are derived,
  which provide a set of design rules for such devices.
