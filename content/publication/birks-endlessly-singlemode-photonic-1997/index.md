abstract: We made an all-silica optical fiber by embedding a central core in a two-dimensional
  photonic crystal with a micrometer-spaced hexagonal array of air holes. An effective-index
  model confirms that such a fiber can be single mode for any wavelength. Its useful
  single-mode range within the transparency window of silica, although wide, is ultimately
  bounded by a bend-loss edge at short wavelengths as well as at long wavelengths.
