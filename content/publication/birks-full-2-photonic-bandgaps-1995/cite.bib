 abstract = {Full 2-D photonic bandgaps are demonstrated for all polarisations in structures with refractive index contrast as small as that of silica and air. They occur for light propagating out of the transverse plane with a longitudinal component of wave vector. A new type of optical fibre based on these structures is proposed.},
