abstract: Light is coupled from the guided mode along one tapered optical fiber into
  the whispering gallery modes around the circumference of another. Small diameter
  variations in the second fiber are measured by tracking, at different points along
  it, the wavelengths at which these modes exist. The measurement does not require
  any optical alignment, and its resolution can be 1 part in 10 000 or better.
