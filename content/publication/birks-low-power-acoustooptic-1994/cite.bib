 abstract = {A new type of fiber acousto-optic device, based on tapered single-mode fiber, is described. Unlike earlier designs, the overlap between the acoustic and optical waves is complete, so very little acoustic power is required. Maximum coupling in an experimental device was attained for an electrical drive power of just 0.5 mW.$<>$},
