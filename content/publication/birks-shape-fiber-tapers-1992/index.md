abstract: A model for the shape of optical fiber tapers, formed by stretching a fiber
  in a heat source of varying length, is presented. Simple assumptions avoid any need
  for the techniques of fluid mechanics. It is found that any decreasing shape of
  taper can be produced. The procedure for calculating the hot-zone length variation
  required to produce a given shape of taper is described, and is used to indicate
  how an optical adiabatic taper can be made. A traveling burner tapering system is
  capable of realizing the model's prediction, and a complete practical procedure
  for the formation of fiber tapers with any reasonable shape is thus presented.$<>$
