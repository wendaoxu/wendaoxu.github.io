 abstract = {Simple expressions for the coupling between the LP01 and LP11 modes of a two-mode optical fiber with a periodic microbending structure are developed. Implementation of the microbend structure using a flexural acoustic wave is described. The dependences of the acoustic frequency and power requirements on the pertinent fiber parameters are presented.},
