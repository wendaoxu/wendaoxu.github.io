abstract: Simple expressions for the coupling between the LP01 and LP11 modes of a
  two-mode optical fiber with a periodic microbending structure are developed. Implementation
  of the microbend structure using a flexural acoustic wave is described. The dependences
  of the acoustic frequency and power requirements on the pertinent fiber parameters
  are presented.
