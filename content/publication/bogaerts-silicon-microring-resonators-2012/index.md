abstract: 'An overview is presented of the current state-of-the-art in silicon nanophotonic
  ring resonators. Basic theory of ring resonators is discussed, and applied to the
  peculiarities of submicron silicon photonic wire waveguides: the small dimensions
  and tight bend radii, sensitivity to perturbations and the boundary conditions of
  the fabrication processes. Theory is compared to quantitative measurements. Finally,
  several of the more promising applications of silicon ring resonators are discussed:
  filters and optical delay lines, label-free biosensors, and active rings for efficient
  modulators and even light sources.'
