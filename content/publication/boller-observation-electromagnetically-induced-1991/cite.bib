 abstract = {We report the first demonstration of a technique by which an optically thick medium may be rendered transparent. The transparency results from a destructive interference of two dressed states which are created by applying a temporally smooth coupling laser between a bound state of an atom and the upper state of the transition which is to be made transparent. The transmittance of an autoionizing (ultraviolet) transition in Sr is changed from exp(-20) without a coupling laser present to exp(-1) in the presence of a coupling laser., This article appears in the following collection:},
