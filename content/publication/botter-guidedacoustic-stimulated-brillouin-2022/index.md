abstract: Coherent optomechanical interaction known as stimulated Brillouin scattering
  (SBS) can enable ultrahigh resolution signal processing and narrow-linewidth lasers.
  SBS has recently been studied extensively in integrated waveguides; however, many
  implementations rely on complicated fabrication schemes. The absence of SBS in standard
  and mature fabrication platforms prevents its large-scale circuit integration. Notably,
  SBS in the emerging silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integration platform is currently
  out of reach because of the lack of acoustic guidance. Here, we demonstrate advanced
  control of backward SBS in multilayer Si3N4 waveguides. By optimizing the separation
  between two Si3N4 layers, we unlock acoustic waveguiding in this platform, potentially
  leading up to 15Ã— higher Brillouin gain coefficient than previously possible in
  Si3N4 waveguides. We use the enhanced SBS gain to demonstrate a high-rejection microwave
  photonic notch filter. This demonstration opens a path to achieving Brillouin-based
  photonic circuits in a standard, low-loss Si3N4 platform.
