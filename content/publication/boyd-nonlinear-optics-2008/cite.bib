 abstract = {Nonlinear optics is the study of the interaction of intense laser light with matter. The third edition of this textbook has been rewritten to conform to the standard SI system of units and includes comprehensively updated material on the latest developments in the field. The book presents an introduction to the entire field of optical physics and specifically the area of nonlinear optics, covering fundamental issues and applied aspects of this exciting area. Nonlinear Optics will have lasting appeal to a wide audience of physics, optics, and electrical engineering students, as well as to working researchers and engineers. Those in related fields, such as materials science and chemistry, will also find this book of particular interest.Presents an introduction to the entire field of optical physics from the perspective of nonlinear opticsCombines first-rate pedagogy with a treatment of fundamental aspects of nonlinear opticsCovers all the latest topics and technology in this ever-evolving industryStrong emphasis on the fundamentals},
