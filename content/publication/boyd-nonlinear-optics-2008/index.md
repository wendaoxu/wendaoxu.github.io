abstract: Nonlinear optics is the study of the interaction of intense laser light
  with matter. The third edition of this textbook has been rewritten to conform to
  the standard SI system of units and includes comprehensively updated material on
  the latest developments in the field. The book presents an introduction to the entire
  field of optical physics and specifically the area of nonlinear optics, covering
  fundamental issues and applied aspects of this exciting area. Nonlinear Optics will
  have lasting appeal to a wide audience of physics, optics, and electrical engineering
  students, as well as to working researchers and engineers. Those in related fields,
  such as materials science and chemistry, will also find this book of particular
  interest.Presents an introduction to the entire field of optical physics from the
  perspective of nonlinear opticsCombines first-rate pedagogy with a treatment of
  fundamental aspects of nonlinear opticsCovers all the latest topics and technology
  in this ever-evolving industryStrong emphasis on the fundamentals
