abstract: A Twist on the Capacity Crunch The rate at which data can be transmitted
  down optic fibers is approaching a limit because of nonlinear optical effects. Multiplexing
  allows data to be encoded in different modes of light such as polarization, wavelength,
  amplitude, and phase and to be sent down the fibers in parallel. Optical angular
  momentum (OAM) can provide another degree of freedom whereby the photons are given
  a well-defined twist or helicity. Bozinovic et al. (p. 1545) were able to transmit
  high-bandwidth data using OAM modes in long lengths of optical fibers, thus providing
  a possible route to get yet more capacity through optic fiber networks. Internet
  data traffic capacity is rapidly reaching limits imposed by optical fiber nonlinear
  effects. Having almost exhausted available degrees of freedom to orthogonally multiplex
  data, the possibility is now being explored of using spatial modes of fibers to
  enhance data capacity. We demonstrate the viability of using the orbital angular
  momentum (OAM) of light to create orthogonal, spatially distinct streams of data-transmitting
  channels that are multiplexed in a single fiber. Over 1.1 kilometers of a specially
  designed optical fiber that minimizes mode coupling, we achieved 400-gigabits-per-second
  data transmission using four angular momentum modes at a single wavelength, and
  1.6 terabits per second using two OAM modes over 10 wavelengths. These demonstrations
  suggest that OAM could provide an additional degree of freedom for data multiplexing
  in future fiber networks. Encoding data in the twist, or helicity, of photons provides
  a route to increase optical communication rates in fibers. Encoding data in the
