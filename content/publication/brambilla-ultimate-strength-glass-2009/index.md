abstract: 'In the past decade nanowires have attracted an increase interest because
  of their extraordinary mechanical strength. In fact, material properties in the
  nanoregime are extremely different from those found in macroscopic samples: few
  crystalline materials have shown a tensile strength in excess of 10 GPa in the form
  of nanowires. Still the length of defect-free crystalline nanowires is limited to
  a few millimeters and the strength of long nanowires is compromised by defects.
  The strength of glass nanowires is less affected by single defects. In this paper
  we present the ultimate strength of glass silica nanowires manufactured by a top-down
  fabrication technique; this is the highest value reported for glass materials. The
  measured ultimate strength is in excess of 10 GPa and increases for decreasing nanowire
  diameters. Scanning electron micrographs of the broken fragments showed a fragile
  rupture.'
