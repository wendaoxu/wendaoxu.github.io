abstract: We explore the possibilities of achieving larger out-of-plane band gaps
  in two-dimensional silica/air photonic crystals with hexagonal symmetry. By modification
  of the basic hexagonal unit-cell, we demonstrate a new photonic crystal structure,
  for which the size of the band gaps is increased several times compared to those
  of simple hexagonal structures. The new structure allows design of silica/air photonic
  crystals exhibiting complete out-of-plane two-dimensional photonic band gaps for
  realistic fabrication parameters. We propose a new design of photonic crystal fibers
  based on the modified hexagonal structure. The advantages of the new design over
  recently fabricated photonic crystal fibers are discussed, and a calculation of
  a guided mode, localized at a low-index core region, is presented.
