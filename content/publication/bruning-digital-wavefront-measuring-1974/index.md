abstract: A self-scanned 1024 element photodiode array and minicomputer are used to
  measure the phase (wavefront) in the interference pattern of an interferometer to
  $łambda$/100. The photodiode array samples intensities over a 32 × 32 matrix in
  the interference pattern as the length of the reference arm is varied piezoelectrically.
  Using these data the minicomputer synchronously detects the phase at each of the
  1024 points by a Fourier series method and displays the wavefront in contour and
  perspective plot on a storage oscilloscope in less than 1 min (Bruning et al. Paper
  WE16, OSA Annual Meeting, Oct. 1972). The array of intensities is sampled and averaged
  many times in a random fashion so that the effects of air turbulence, vibrations,
  and thermal drifts are minimized. Very significant is the fact that wavefront errors
  in the interferometer are easily determined and may be automatically subtracted
  from current or subsequent wavefrots. Various programs supporting the measurement
  system include software for determining the aperture boundary, sum and difference
  of wavefronts, removal or insertion of tilt and focus errors, and routines for spatial
  manipulation of wavefronts. FFT programs transform wavefront data into point spread
  function and modulus and phase of the optical transfer function of lenses. Display
  programs plot these functions in contour and perspective. The system has been designed
  to optimize the collection of data to give higher than usual accuracy in measuring
  the individual elements and final performance of assembled diffraction limited optical
  systems, and furthermore, the short loop time of a few minutes makes the system
  an attractive alternative to constraints imposed by test glasses in the optical
  shop.
