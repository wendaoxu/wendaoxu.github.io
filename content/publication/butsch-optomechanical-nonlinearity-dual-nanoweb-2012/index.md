abstract: A novel kind of nanostructured optical fiber, displaying an extremely high
  and optically broadband optomechanical nonlinearity, is presented. It comprises
  two closely spaced ultrathin glass membranes (webs) suspended in air and attached
  to the inner walls of a glass fiber capillary. Light guided in this dual-web structure
  can exert attractive or repulsive pressure on the webs, causing them to be pushed
  together or pulled apart. The elastic deflection of the webs is, in turn, coupled
  to the electromagnetic field distribution and results in a change in the effective
  refractive index within the fiber. Employing a pump-probe technique in an interferometric
  setup, optomechanically induced refractive index changes more than 104 times larger
  than the Kerr effect are detected. Theoretical estimates of the optomechanical nonlinearity
  agree well with the experimental results. The dual-web fiber combines the sensitivity
  of a microoptomechanical device with the versatility of an optical fiber and could
  trigger new developments in the fields of nonlinear optics, optical metrology, and
  sensing.
