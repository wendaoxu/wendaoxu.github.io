abstract: It is shown that optomechanical forces can cause nonlinear self-channeling
  of light in a planar dual-slab waveguide. A system of two parallel silica nanowebs,
  spaced $∼$100 nm and supported inside a fiber capillary, is studied theoretically
  and an iterative scheme developed to analyze its nonlinear optomechanical properties.
  Steady-state field distributions and mechanical deformation profiles are obtained,
  demonstrating that self-channeling is possible in realistic structures at launched
  powers as low as a few mW. The differential optical nonlinearity of the self-channeled
  mode can be as much as 10×106 times higher than the corresponding electronic Kerr
  nonlinearity. It is also intrinsically broadband, does not utilize resonant effects,
  can be viewed as a consequence of the extreme nonlocality of the mechanical response,
  and in fact is a notable example of a so-called accessible soliton.
