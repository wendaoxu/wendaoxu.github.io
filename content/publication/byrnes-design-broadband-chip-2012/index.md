abstract: 'We propose a scheme for on-chip isolation in chalcogenide (As2S3) rib waveguides,
  in which Stimulated Brillouin Scattering is used to induce non-reciprocal mode conversion
  within a multi-moded waveguide. The design exploits the idea that a chalcogenide
  rib buried in a silica matrix acts as waveguide for both light and sound, and can
  also be designed to be multi-moded for both optical and acoustic waves. The enhanced
  opto-acoustic coupling allows significant isolation (&gt; 20 dB) within a chip-scale
  (cm-long) device (&lt; 10 cm). We also show that the bandwidth of this device can
  be dramatically increased by tuning the dispersion of the waveguide to match the
  group velocity between optical modes: we find that 20 dB isolation can be extended
  over a bandwidth of 25 nm.'
