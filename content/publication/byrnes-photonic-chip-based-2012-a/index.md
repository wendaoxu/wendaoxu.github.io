abstract: We report the first demonstration of a photonic chip based dynamically reconfigurable,
  widely tunable, narrow pass-band, high Q microwave photonic filter (MPF). We exploit
  stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a 6.5 cm long chalcogenide (As2S3) photonic
  chip to demonstrate a MPF that exhibited a high quality factor of ~520 and narrow
  bandwidth and was dynamically reconfigurable and widely tunable. It maintained a
  stable 3 dB bandwidth of 23 textpm 2MHz and amplitude of 20 textpm 2 dB over a large
  frequency tuning range of 2-12 GHz. By tailoring the pump spectrum, we reconfigured
  the 3 dB bandwidth of the MPF from ~20 MHz to ~40 MHz and tuned the shape factor
  from 3.5 to 2 resulting in a nearly flat-topped filter profile. This demonstration
  represents a significant advance in integrated microwave photonics with potential
  applications in on-chip microwave signal processing for RADAR and analogue communications.
