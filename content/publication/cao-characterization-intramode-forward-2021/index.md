abstract: We present the characteristics of intra-mode forward stimulated Brillouin
  scattering (FSBS) induced by HE11 and high-order optical mode (HOM) in nanofibers,
  respectively. Multiple transverse acoustic modes (TAMs) would be excited in the
  FSBS process. However, only a few specific low-order TAMs participate in the interaction
  of different optical mode pairs and then contribute to Brillouin gain. Meanwhile,
  the changes of dominating Brillouin peaks with the nanofiber radius are shown in
  detail, which further clearly confirms the difference in the gain characteristics
  of different intra-mode Brillouin gain spectrums. Especially, several obvious maximum
  and minimum gain values exist at the nanofiber radius of around 0.8 $Î¼$m. The HOM
  induced intra-mode FSBS is of great importance for understanding of the phonon--photon
  interaction in multi-mode waveguides.
