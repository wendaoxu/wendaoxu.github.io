abstract: We comprehensively investigate the process of forward stimulated Brillouin
  scattering in nanofibers, considering the electrostrictive body force, electrostrictive
  pressure, and radiation pressure. The forward Brillouin gain spectrum in a radio
  frequency range from 1 to 14&#x00A0;GHz is analyzed for nanofiber radii varying
  from 150 to 1500&#x00A0;nm. Only transverse acoustic modes contribute to the forward
  Brillouin gain because of the transverse nature of optical forces in forward scattering.
  We reveal that, during the process of forward stimulated Brillouin scattering, the
  Brillouin effects caused by the low-order surface transverse acoustic modes play
  a dominant role in the gain spectrum. The photoacoustic mechanism of forward stimulated
  Brillouin scattering in nanofibers may open new avenues in many applications, such
  as optical sensing.
