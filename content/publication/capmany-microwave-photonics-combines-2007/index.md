abstract: Microwave photonics, which brings together the worlds of radiofrequency
  engineering and optoelectronics, has attracted great interest from both the research
  community and the commercial sector over the past 30 years and is set to have a
  bright future. The technology makes it possible to have functions in microwave systems
  that are complex or even not directly possible in the radiofrequency domain and
  also creates new opportunities for telecommunication networks. Here we introduce
  the technology to the photonics community and summarize recent research and important
  applications.
