abstract: Microwave photonic filters are photonic subsystems designed with the aim
  of carrying equivalent tasks to those of an ordinary microwave filter within a radio
  frequency (RF) system or link, bringing supplementary advantages inherent to photonics
  such as low loss, high bandwidth, immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI),
  tunability, and reconfigurability. There is an increasing interest in this subject
  since, on one hand, emerging broadband wireless access networks and standards spanning
  from universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) to fixed access picocellular
  networks and including wireless local area network (WLAN), World Interoperability
  for Microwave Access, Inc. (WIMAX), local multipoint distribution service (LMDS),
  etc., require an increase in capacity by reducing the coverage area. An enabling
  technology to obtain this objective is based on radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems where
  signal processing is carried at a central office to where signals are carried from
  inexpensive remote antenna units (RAUs). On the other hand, microwave photonic filters
  can find applications in specialized fields such as radar and photonic beamsteering
  of phased-arrayed antennas, where dynamical reconfiguration is an added value. This
  paper provides a tutorial introduction of this subject to the reader not working
  directly in the field but interested in getting an overall introduction of the subject
  and also to the researcher wishing to get a comprehensive background before working
  on the subject.
