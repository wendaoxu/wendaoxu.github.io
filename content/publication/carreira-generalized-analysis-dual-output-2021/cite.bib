 abstract = {We propose a general and exact analytical model forintensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) fiber optic links using dual-output dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DO-MZM). This model extends previously published results relying on the small-signal approximation and infinite extinction ratio at the modulator outputs. In our treatment the output optical powers are calculated through analytical expressions taking into account the modulator electronic driver and directional coupler characteristics. Closed-form expressions, explicitly displaying the dependence of the link output power on the directional coupler transmission coefficients, optical modulation depth, and bias point, are obtained for output optical power, frequency chirp, extinction ratio and static characteristic MZM curves. We also propose an equivalent interferometric representation of each DO-MZM output in terms of virtual dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulators (DD-MZMs) and show that each modulator output has distinct characteristic curves. The model is applied to a photonic-assisted instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) based on frequency-to-power mapping, in which an amplitude comparison function (ACF) is generated by the power fading functions. We have obtained a generalized ACF through which both the frequency and amplitude of the input RF signal can be determined by a search procedure.},
