abstract: We propose a general and exact analytical model forintensity modulation
  and direct detection (IM/DD) fiber optic links using dual-output dual-drive Mach-Zehnder
  modulator (DO-MZM). This model extends previously published results relying on the
  small-signal approximation and infinite extinction ratio at the modulator outputs.
  In our treatment the output optical powers are calculated through analytical expressions
  taking into account the modulator electronic driver and directional coupler characteristics.
  Closed-form expressions, explicitly displaying the dependence of the link output
  power on the directional coupler transmission coefficients, optical modulation depth,
  and bias point, are obtained for output optical power, frequency chirp, extinction
  ratio and static characteristic MZM curves. We also propose an equivalent interferometric
  representation of each DO-MZM output in terms of virtual dual-drive Mach-Zehnder
  modulators (DD-MZMs) and show that each modulator output has distinct characteristic
  curves. The model is applied to a photonic-assisted instantaneous frequency measurement
  (IFM) based on frequency-to-power mapping, in which an amplitude comparison function
  (ACF) is generated by the power fading functions. We have obtained a generalized
  ACF through which both the frequency and amplitude of the input RF signal can be
  determined by a search procedure.
