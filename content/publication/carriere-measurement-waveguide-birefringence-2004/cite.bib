 abstract = {A simple method for accurately measuring the birefringence of a ring resonator waveguide using its resonant characteristics is presented. A measurement accuracy of 1/spl times/10/sup -6/ is observed. This approach is then used to measure the effect of thermal annealing on the level of birefringence in an ion-exchanged waveguide.},
