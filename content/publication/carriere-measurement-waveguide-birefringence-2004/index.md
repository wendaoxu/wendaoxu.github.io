abstract: A simple method for accurately measuring the birefringence of a ring resonator
  waveguide using its resonant characteristics is presented. A measurement accuracy
  of 1/spl times/10/sup -6/ is observed. This approach is then used to measure the
  effect of thermal annealing on the level of birefringence in an ion-exchanged waveguide.
