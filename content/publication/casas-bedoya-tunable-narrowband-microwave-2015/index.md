abstract: We demonstrate the first, to the best of our knowledge, functional signal
  processing device based on stimulated Brillouin scattering in a silicon nanowire.
  We use only 1&#xA0;dB of on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering gain to create
  an RF photonic notch filter with 48&#xA0;dB of suppression, 98&#xA0;MHz linewidth,
  and 6&#xA0;GHz frequency tuning. This device has potential applications in on-chip
  microwave signal processing and establishes the foundation for the first CMOS-compatible
  high-performance RF photonic filter.
