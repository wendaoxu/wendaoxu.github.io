abstract: We investigate a class of two-dimensional hexagonal structures that possess
  photonic band gaps. This class includes the previously studied triangular structure
  as a particular case. By symmetry analysis, we obtain a clear insight into the gap
  opening and we show how the photonic band gaps are affected by the characteristics
  of materials, according to whether the dielectric constant of the cylinders is larger
  or smaller than the background one. The photonic band structures present numerous
  gaps, and we study the evolution of these gaps as functions of the diameter and
  nature of cylinders. Our results demonstrate the existence of absolute band gaps
  for many configurations, largest gaps being obtained for triangular and graphite
  structures. oÌ§pyright 1996 The American Physical Society.
