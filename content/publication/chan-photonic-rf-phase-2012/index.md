abstract: A new photonic microwave phase shifter that can achieve a full 360&#176;
  phase shift with very little RF signal amplitude variation, and which can operate
  over very wide frequency range, is presented. It is based on controlling the amplitude
  and phase of the optical carrier and the two RF modulation sidebands via the dc
  bias voltages to a dual-parallel Mach--Zehnder modulator (DPMZM). It has a simple
  structure, only requiring a single laser, modulator, and photodetector. A continuous
  360&#176; RF phase shift without changes in the RF signal amplitude is obtained
  by controlling the dc bias voltages of the DPMZM. Experimental results demonstrate
  a very wideband operation of the RF phase shifter over an 8:1 frequency range from
  2 to 16 GHz, a continuous 0--360&#176; RF phase shift with very low amplitude variation
  of &lt; 3 dB of over the entire frequency band, and with a phase deviation standard
  deviation of &lt; 2&#176;.
