 abstract = {The polarization properties of single-mode optical fibers are theoretically modeled with use of the Jones formalism. The fiber is described as an elliptical birefringent plate. The properties predicted by this model are discussed and lead to the development of a simple experimental method to extract the parameters that describe a real fiber. A magneto-optic method that measures the beat length of the fiber is also presented and gives a more complete description of the fiber. The validity of the model is then clearly established. Finally, the wavelength dependence of the parameters characteristic of the fiber is experimentally investigated.},
