abstract: The polarization properties of single-mode optical fibers are theoretically
  modeled with use of the Jones formalism. The fiber is described as an elliptical
  birefringent plate. The properties predicted by this model are discussed and lead
  to the development of a simple experimental method to extract the parameters that
  describe a real fiber. A magneto-optic method that measures the beat length of the
  fiber is also presented and gives a more complete description of the fiber. The
  validity of the model is then clearly established. Finally, the wavelength dependence
  of the parameters characteristic of the fiber is experimentally investigated.
