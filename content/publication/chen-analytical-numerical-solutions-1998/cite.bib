 abstract = {Exact (both analytical and numerical) solutions for steady state stimulated Brillouin scattering in single mode optical fibers are presented. The resulting solution is compared with the experiment. The threshold for stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in single mode fibers is examined. Saturation and depletion phenomena are analyzed.},
