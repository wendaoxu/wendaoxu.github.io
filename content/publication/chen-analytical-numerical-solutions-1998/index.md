abstract: Exact (both analytical and numerical) solutions for steady state stimulated
  Brillouin scattering in single mode optical fibers are presented. The resulting
  solution is compared with the experiment. The threshold for stimulated Brillouin
  scattering (SBS) in single mode fibers is examined. Saturation and depletion phenomena
  are analyzed.
