 abstract = {In this paper, the forward Brillouin scattering frequency shift of step-index fibers and photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) with different core diameters is investigated by numerical simulation. The result shows that, multiple Brillouin scattering peaks with the shift range from 20 to 800 MHz are generated in the step-index fibers. With the core diameter changing, the Brillouin scattering frequency shift has no change, but the scattering efficiency is different. In the PCFs with periodic air holes, there are a few dominant peaks. The frequency shifts vary with the core diameter changing. For the core diameter of 11.6 $μ$m, there are three peaks at 327.39, 556.48 and 824.14 MHz, respectively. When the core diameter decreases to 2.32 $μ$m, the frequency shifts of forward Brilloun scattering are 1.619, 2.779 and 4.123 GHz, respectively. The forward Brillouin frequency shifts increase with the core diameter decreasing. The results will be useful for the research on the mechanism of forward Brillouin scattering and have potential applications on the field of nonlinear fiber optics.},
