abstract: In this paper, a novel birefringence measurement method through the Rayleigh
  backscattered lightwave within single-mode fiber is proposed, using a single chirped-pulse
  with arbitrary state of polarization. Numerical analysis is carried out in detail,
  then pulse-compression phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (PC-$Φ$-OTDR)
  with polarization-diverse coherent detection is employed to verify this method.
  A 2km spun single-mode fiber is tested with 8.6 cm spatial resolution, and the average
  birefringence of the fiber under test is measured as 0.234rad/m, which is consistent
  with previous literatures about single-mode fiber. Moreover, the relationship between
  the measured birefringence and the spatial resolution is also studied for the first
  time, and the results show that spatial resolution is crucial for fiber birefringence
  measurement.
