 abstract = {Robust sub-millihertz-level offset locking was achieved with a simple scheme, by which we were able to transfer the laser frequency stability and accuracy from either cesium-stabilized diode laser or comb laser to the other diode lasers who had serious frequency jitter previously. The offset lock developed in this paper played an important role in atomic two-photon spectroscopy with which record resolution and new determination on the hyperfine constants of cesium atom were achieved. A quantum-interference experiment was performed to show the improvement of light coherence as an extended design was implemented.},
