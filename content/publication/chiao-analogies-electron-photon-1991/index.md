abstract: The phenomenon of tunneling is a well-known fundamental consequence of quantum
  mechanics. All particles can in principle tunnel. In particular, both electrons
  and photons can tunnel through classically forbidden regions of space known as ``barriers''.
  However, there have been numerous controversies over how long it takes a particle
  to cross a barrier. Exploiting an analogy between electrons and photons, we suggest
  an experiment to infer the characteristics of an electron's barrier-traversal time
  by measuring the time it takes a photon to traverse a similar barrier. Electron
  tunneling experiments are in general much more difficult to perform than analogous
  optical ones. With an optical technique one can construct optical barriers on the
  scale of microns, in contrast to the√•ngstrom-scale barriers required for electron
  tunneling. Our experiment may help settle the controversies over tunneling times.
  By means of a newly developed quantum optical technique, we should be able to measure
  the tunneling times of individual photons with sub-picosecond resolution. In our
  experiments we are using a two-photon light source, in which a pair of tightly correlated
  photons is generated by the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Hong,
  Ou and Mandel have already achieved a sub-picosecond comparison between the arrival
  times of two such photons at a beam splitter placed at the intersection of their
  paths. In our geometry, one member of the photon pair tunnels through a barrier,
  while the other does not. Then coincidence detection of this photon pair constitutes
  the detection of an individual tunneling event. The particle aspect of photon tunneling
  can thus be clearly observed. We propose to use the Hong-Ou-Mandel technique to
  measure the tunneling time. We have chosen for our tunneling barrier two glass prisms
  placed in close proximity, utilizing the phenomenon of frustrated total internal
  reflection.
