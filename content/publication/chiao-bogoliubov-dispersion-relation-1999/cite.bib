 abstract = {The Bogoliubov dispersion relation for the elementary excitations of the weakly interacting Bose gas is shown to hold for the case of the weakly interacting photon gas (the ``photon fluid'') in a nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity. The chemical potential of a photon in the two-dimensional photon fluid does not vanish. The Bogoliubov relation, which is also derived by means of a linearized fluctuation analysis in classical nonlinear optics, implies the possibility of a new, superfluid state of light. The theory underlying an experiment in progress to observe sound waves in the photon fluid is described, and another experiment to measure the critical velocity of this superfluid is proposed.},
