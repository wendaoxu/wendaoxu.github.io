abstract: The Bogoliubov dispersion relation for the elementary excitations of the
  weakly interacting Bose gas is shown to hold for the case of the weakly interacting
  photon gas (the ``photon fluid'') in a nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity. The chemical
  potential of a photon in the two-dimensional photon fluid does not vanish. The Bogoliubov
  relation, which is also derived by means of a linearized fluctuation analysis in
  classical nonlinear optics, implies the possibility of a new, superfluid state of
  light. The theory underlying an experiment in progress to observe sound waves in
  the photon fluid is described, and another experiment to measure the critical velocity
  of this superfluid is proposed.
