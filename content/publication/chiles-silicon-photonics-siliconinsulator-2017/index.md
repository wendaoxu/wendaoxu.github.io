abstract: 'The standard platform for silicon photonics has been ridge or channel waveguides
  fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. SOI waveguides are so versatile
  and the technology built around it is so mature and popular that silicon photonics
  is almost regarded as synonymous with SOI photonics. However, due to several shortcomings
  of SOI photonics, novel platforms have been recently emerging. The shortcomings
  could be categorized into two sets: (a) those due to using silicon as the waveguide
  core material; and (b) those due to using silicon dioxide as the bottom cladding
  layer. Several heterogeneous platforms have been developed to address the first
  set of shortcomings. In such important heterogeneous integrated photonic platforms,
  the top silicon layer of SOI is typically replaced by a thin film of another optical
  material with a refractive index higher than the buried oxide (BOX) bottom cladding
  layer. Silicon is still usually preferred as the substrate of choice, but silicon
  has no optical functionality. In contrast, the second category of solutions aim
  at using silicon as the core waveguide material, while resolving issues related
  to the BOX layer. Particularly, one of the main drawbacks of SOI is that the BOX
  layer induces high optical loss in the mid-wavelength infrared (mid-IR) range. Accordingly,
  a host of platforms have been proposed, and some have been demonstrated, in which
  the BOX is replaced with insulating materials that have low intrinsic loss in the
  mid-IR. Examples are sapphire, lithium niobate, silicon nitride and air (suspended
  Si membrane waveguides). Although silicon is still the preferred substrate, sometimes
  a thin film of silicon, on which the optical waveguide is formed, is directly placed
  on top of another substrate (e.g., sapphire or lithium niobate). These alternative
  substrates act as both mechanical support and the lower cladding layer. In addition
  to the demands of mid-IR photonics, the non-SOI platforms can potentially offer
  other advantages and flexibilities. Examples are different, and sometimes interesting,
  guided mode properties (e.g., single-mode and single-polarization behavior), enhanced
  dispersion engineering (wideband anomalous regimes), as well as ease of fabrication
  and higher thermal conductivity in some cases. The objective of this article is
  to review this category of non-SOI photonic platforms that use silicon as the waveguide
  core layer and discuss their challenges and opportunities.'
