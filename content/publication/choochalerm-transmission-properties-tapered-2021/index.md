abstract: We measured the transmission of tapered and untapered optical fibres as
  a function of input beam numerical aperture at 635nm. The tapered fibres were fabricated
  with an adiabatic tapering process from graded and step-index fibres with 50$Î¼$m
  core diameters to form a 100mm long taper with 5:1 taper ratio. We tested tapered
  graded-index and step-index fibres fabricated from commercial Thorlabs products
  and a custom graded-index taper. The 5:1 tapered graded-index fibre can give a transmission
  greater than 0.4 for Thorlabs and 0.6 for the custom taper. We simulated the transmission
  of the tapered fibres and found reasonable agreement with the measured graded-index
  tapered fibre results across the numerical aperture range of interest. Experimentally,
  step-index tapered fibres performed relative poorly and considerably below modelling
  expectations. Based on our examinations this arises because the properties of step-index
  fibre were not robust to the tapering process. Suitably tapered graded-index fibres
  may offer a new route for efficient focal ratio reduction of fibre optic signals,
  e.g., in fibre-fed spectrographs, though we stress that our measurements have been
  limited to monochromatic light in this work.
