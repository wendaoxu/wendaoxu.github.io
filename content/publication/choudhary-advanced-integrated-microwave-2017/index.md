abstract: Processing of microwave signals using photonics has several key advantages
  for applications in wireless communications. However, to bring photonic-based microwave
  signal processing to the mainstream requires a reduction of the form factor. Integration
  is a route for achieving high-performance, low-cost, and small-footprint microwave
  photonic devices. A high on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) gain is essential
  for synthesizing several key functionalities for advanced integrated microwave signal
  processing. We have optimized our on-chip SBS platform to achieve a record on-chip
  gain of 52 dB. In this paper, we discuss the implications of this giant gain from
  the viewpoint of new enabled technologies. The giant gain can be distributed over
  wide frequencies, which can be exploited for the realization of reconfigurable microwave
  bandpass, bandstop, and multiband filters. High gain also enables the demonstration
  of low-threshold on-chip lasers, which can be of relevance for a low-noise radio-frequency
  signal generation. These wide ranges of functionalities are made possible by the
  breakthrough on-chip gain makes Brillouin-based microwave photonic signal processing
  a promising approach for real-world implementation in the near future.
