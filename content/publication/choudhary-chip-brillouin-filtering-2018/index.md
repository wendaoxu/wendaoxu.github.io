abstract: High-resolution signal processing will be a key aspect in current and future
  communication networks in crowded spectral environments. Signal processing based
  on the nonlinear optical process known as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS)
  are applicable in high-performance analog signal filtering for radio frequency (RF)
  communications and in coherent optical communication systems for carrier amplification.
  To meet the requirements of small size, low weight, and low power, the development
  of chip-based devices is critical. In this paper, we present an overview of on-chip
  SBS demonstrations of RF bandpass and bandstop filter functionalities with large
  frequency tuning and reconfigurability from tens of MHz to almost 0.5 GHz, applicable
  in RF communications. We also present our recent results on chip-based SBS filtering
  for optical communications. While traditionally SBS has been deemed to be incompatible
  with phase-sensitive communications, these latest results highlight the viability
  of SBS-enhanced high-capacity digital communication networks. We finally discuss
  the limitations of SBS filtering and also present some strategies to overcome them.
