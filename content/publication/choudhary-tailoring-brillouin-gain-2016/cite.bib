 abstract = {An unprecedented Brillouin gain of 44&#xA0;dB in a photonic chip enables the realization of broadly tunable and reconfigurable integrated microwave photonic filters. More than a decade bandwidth reconfigurability from 30 up to 440&#xA0;MHz, with a passband ripple &lt;1.9&#x2009;&#x2009;dB is achieved by tailoring the Brillouin pump. The filter central frequency is continuously tuned up to 30&#xA0;GHz with no degradation of the passband response, which is a major improvement over electronic filters. Furthermore, we demonstrate pump tailoring to realize multiple bandpass filters with different bandwidths and central frequencies, paving the way for multiple on-chip microwave filters and channelizers.},
