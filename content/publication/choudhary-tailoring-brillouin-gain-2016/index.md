abstract: An unprecedented Brillouin gain of 44&#xA0;dB in a photonic chip enables
  the realization of broadly tunable and reconfigurable integrated microwave photonic
  filters. More than a decade bandwidth reconfigurability from 30 up to 440&#xA0;MHz,
  with a passband ripple &lt;1.9&#x2009;&#x2009;dB is achieved by tailoring the Brillouin
  pump. The filter central frequency is continuously tuned up to 30&#xA0;GHz with
  no degradation of the passband response, which is a major improvement over electronic
  filters. Furthermore, we demonstrate pump tailoring to realize multiple bandpass
  filters with different bandwidths and central frequencies, paving the way for multiple
  on-chip microwave filters and channelizers.
