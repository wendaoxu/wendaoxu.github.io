abstract: Conventional distributed Brillouin sensing allows real-time sampling at
  high spatial resolution, but is so far restricted to measuring quantities inside
  the fibre core. Here, Chow et al. demonstrate a distributed forward Brillouin sensor
  that is sensitive to quantities outside the fibre bulk.
