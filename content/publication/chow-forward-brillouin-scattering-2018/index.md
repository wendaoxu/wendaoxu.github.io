abstract: The standard single-mode fiber has been demonstrated as an optomechanical
  sensor recently to measure the acoustic impedances of surrounding liquids by means
  of the generation and detection of forward-stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS).
  FSBS allows the mechanical properties of an external material to be probed directly
  through the interaction of guided light and transverse sound waves that occurs entirely
  inside the fiber structure. In this technique, having a low-loss interface between
  the fiber bulk and the external medium is essential for precise measurement; however,
  it leads to the necessary but impractical removal of the thick polymer fiber coating
  in most reported methods. Here, we use a commercially available 80-$μ$m-diameter
  optical fiber coated with a 8-$μ$m-thick polyimide coating layer to measure the
  acoustic impedances of the surrounding liquids, showing accurate measurement results
  while retaining the mechanical strength of the fiber.
