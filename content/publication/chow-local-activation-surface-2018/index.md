abstract: Elastic vibrations in subwavelength structures have gained importance recently
  in fundamental light--matter studies and various optoacoustic applications. Existing
  techniques have revealed the presence of distinct acoustic resonances inside silica
  microwires yet remain unable to individually localize them. Here, we locally activate
  distinct classes of acoustic resonances inside a tapered fiber using a phase-correlation
  distributed Brillouin method. Experimental results verify the presence of surface
  and hybrid acoustic waves at distinct fiber locations and demonstrate, to the best
  of our knowledge, the first distributed surface acoustic wave measurement. This
  technique is important for understanding properties of optoacoustic interactions
  and enabling designs of novel optomechanical devices.
