abstract: An exact and fast analytic method based on power series is established to
  predict the modal field distributions, Petermann-2 spot size, the normalized propagation
  constant corresponding to fundamental and first higher order mode in graded index
  fibers with any arbitrary power law profile. The variation of normalized cut-off
  frequencies of some LPlm modes in graded index fibers with different profile exponents
  are also shown here and an empirical relation between them is determined.
