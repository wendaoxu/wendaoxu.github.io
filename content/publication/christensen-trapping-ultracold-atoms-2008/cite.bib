 abstract = {Ultracold sodium atoms have been trapped inside a hollow-core optical fiber. The atoms are transferred from a free-space optical dipole trap into a trap formed by a red-detuned Gaussian light mode confined to the core of the fiber. We show that at least 5% of the atoms held initially in the free-space trap can be loaded into the core of the fiber and retrieved outside.},
