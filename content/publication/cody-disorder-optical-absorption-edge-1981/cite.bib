 abstract = {The effect of thermal and structural disorder on the electronic structure of hydrogenated amorphous silicon is investigated by measurement of the shape of the optical absorption edge as a function of temperature and thermal evolution of hydrogen. The data are consistent with the idea that the thermal and structural disorder are additive, and suggest that the disorder, rather than the hydrogen content, is the fundamental determining factor in the optical band gap.},
