abstract: "Introduction: Care management focuses on improving coordination of care
  and improving health-related behaviors for identified, at-risk populations. There
  have been relatively few studies of care management interventions that used randomized
  controlled clinical trial design. These studies have yielded discrepant results.
  Methods: Randomized controlled studies of asthma care management interventions were
  identified and summarized. Common themes of beneficial and nonbeneficial programs
  were identified. Results: The randomized clinical trials that did show benefit targeted
  low-income, inner-city patients with poorly controlled asthma and incorporated in-person
  plus telephone visits. Several programs provided services to reduce asthma triggers
  in the home; programs that did not show benefit targeted populations with relatively
  high levels of adherence to inhaled corticosteroid and did not provide resources
  (other than advice) for environmental remediation. One study that failed to show
  benefit had a fragmented, subcontracted care management process that was not connected
  to the child's medical home. Innovative programs that showed benefit in randomized
  studies and deserve replication include use of community health workers for home
  visits and school-based asthma care management. Conclusions: Asthma care management
  is beneficial in some, but not all populations. The most benefit was seen in populations
  with under-treated, poorly controlled asthma. Fragmented, subcontracted care management
  programs that were not community-based and not connected to the child's medical
  home were not beneficial. A care management process that involved both in-person
  visits and telephone follow-up and provision of resources for reduction of asthma
  triggers in the home were components of successful programs."
