abstract: Tunable semiconductor lasers have been listed in numerous critical technology
  lists for future optical communication and sensing systems. This paper summarizes
  a tutorial that was given at OFC '03. It includes some discussion of why tunable
  lasers might be beneficial, an outline of basic tuning mechanisms, some examples
  of tunable lasers that have been commercialized, and a discussion of control techniques.
  More extensive data is given for the widely-tunable sampled-grating distributed-Bragg-reflector
  (SGDBR) type of laser, including data for such lasers integrated monolithically
  with modulators to form complete transmitter front ends. A summary of reliability
  data for the SGDBR laser is also given. It is concluded that tunable lasers can
  reduce operational costs, that full-band tunability is desirable for many applications,
  that monolithic integration offers the most potential for reducing size, weight,
  power and cost, and that sufficient reliability for system insertion has been demonstrated.
