abstract: A general derivation of the optical modulation process in a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder
  modulator (DD-MZM) is introduced. The expressions include all harmonics and are
  entirely general in terms of bias point. Chromatic dispersion is also included allowing
  the prediction of a number of important phenomena in photonic signal transmission.
  Examples of special cases of these general equations are then presented. Similar
  expressions are introduced for harmonic optical up-conversion through a photonic
  mixer based on a DD-MZM covering any bias point or phase shift between DD-MZM drives.
