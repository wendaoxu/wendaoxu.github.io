abstract: Ultrabroad coherent comb-like optical spectra spanning several octaves are
  a chief ingredient in the emerging field of attoscience. We demonstrate generation
  and guidance of a three-octave spectral comb, spanning wavelengths from 325 to 2300
  nanometers, in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The waveguidance
  results not from a photonic band gap but from the inhibited coupling between the
  core and cladding modes. The spectrum consists of up to 45 high-order Stokes and
  anti-Stokes lines and is generated by driving the confined gas with a single, moderately
  powerful (10-kilowatt) infrared laser, producing 12-nanosecond-duration pulses.
  This represents a reduction by six orders of magnitude in the required laser powers
  over previous equivalent techniques and opens up a robust and much simplified route
  to synthesizing attosecond pulses. A new theory of how photonic-crystal fibers guide
  light is used to design a hydrogen-filled fiber that emits light from 325 to 2300
  nanometers at low input power. A new theory of how photonic-crystal fibers guide
