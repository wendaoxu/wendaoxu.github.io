 abstract = {A general treatment of the phenomenon of frustrated total internal reflection is presented and numerical results are given which are related to cavity resonator design parameters. A minimum loss, minimum alignment requirement resonator is described offering a maximum of versatility. Experimental results of quasi-cw and single-pulse Q switching with a ruby optical maser are presented.},
