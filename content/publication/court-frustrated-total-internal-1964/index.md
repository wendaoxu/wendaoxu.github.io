abstract: A general treatment of the phenomenon of frustrated total internal reflection
  is presented and numerical results are given which are related to cavity resonator
  design parameters. A minimum loss, minimum alignment requirement resonator is described
  offering a maximum of versatility. Experimental results of quasi-cw and single-pulse
  Q switching with a ruby optical maser are presented.
