 abstract = {$<$p$>$The confinement of light within a hollow core (a large air hole) in a silica-air photonic crystal fiber is demonstrated. Only certain wavelength bands are confined and guided down the fiber, each band corresponding to the presence of a full two-dimensional band gap in the photonic crystal cladding. Single-mode vacuum waveguides have a multitude of potential applications from ultrahigh-power transmission to the guiding of cold atoms.$<$/p$>$},
