abstract: $<$p$>$The confinement of light within a hollow core (a large air hole)
  in a silica-air photonic crystal fiber is demonstrated. Only certain wavelength
  bands are confined and guided down the fiber, each band corresponding to the presence
  of a full two-dimensional band gap in the photonic crystal cladding. Single-mode
  vacuum waveguides have a multitude of potential applications from ultrahigh-power
  transmission to the guiding of cold atoms.$<$/p$>$
