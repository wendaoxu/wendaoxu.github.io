abstract: New methods are described for determining tighter upper bounds on the support
  of an object, given the support of its autocorrelation. These upper bounds are shown,
  in a digital experiment, to be useful as object-support constraints used with the
  iterative transform algorithm for solving the phase-retrieval problem.
