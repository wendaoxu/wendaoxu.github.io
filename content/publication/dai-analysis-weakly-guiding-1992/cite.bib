 abstract = {An approximation analysis of the weakly guiding cladded acoustic fiber consisting of a core and an infinite thick cladding both having a hexagonal crystal symmetry is presented. The crystalline Z axis is parallel to the fiber axis. Weak guidance conditions require that all the ratios of the stiffness constant over the density of the core are slightly less than those of the cladding. Approximate dispersion and cutoff equations are derived for all pure guided modes. Dispersion curves of several lower order guided torsional, radial-axial and flexural modes are evaluated using both exact and approximate formulas, and they are in good agreement. A simple approximate dispersion equation for leaky (longitudinal type) modes is also obtained. o̧pyright 1992 IEEE},
