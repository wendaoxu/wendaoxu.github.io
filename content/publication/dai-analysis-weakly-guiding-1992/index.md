abstract: An approximation analysis of the weakly guiding cladded acoustic fiber consisting
  of a core and an infinite thick cladding both having a hexagonal crystal symmetry
  is presented. The crystalline Z axis is parallel to the fiber axis. Weak guidance
  conditions require that all the ratios of the stiffness constant over the density
  of the core are slightly less than those of the cladding. Approximate dispersion
  and cutoff equations are derived for all pure guided modes. Dispersion curves of
  several lower order guided torsional, radial-axial and flexural modes are evaluated
  using both exact and approximate formulas, and they are in good agreement. A simple
  approximate dispersion equation for leaky (longitudinal type) modes is also obtained.
