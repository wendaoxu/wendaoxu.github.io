abstract: Raman and Brillouin scattering are normally quite distinct processes that
  take place when light is resonantly scattered by, respectively, optical and acoustic
  phonons. We show how few-GHz acoustic phonons acquire many of the same characteristics
  as optical phonons when they are tightly trapped, transversely and close to modal
  cut-off, inside the wavelength-scale core of an air-glass photonic crystal fiber
  (PCF). The result is an optical scattering effect that closely resembles Raman scattering,
  though at much lower frequencies. We use photoacoustic techniques to probe the effect
  experimentally and finite element modelling to explain the results. We also show
  by numerical modelling that the cladding structure supports two phononic band gaps
  that contribute to the confinement of sound in the core.
