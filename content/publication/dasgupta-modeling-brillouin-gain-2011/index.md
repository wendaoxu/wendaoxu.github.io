abstract: We report the first detailed implementation of a 2-D finite-element method
  (FEM) through a commercial FEM solver that can be universally applied to calculate
  the Brillouin gain characteristics of optical fibers with arbitrary refractive index
  profiles and material composition, including radially asymmetric and microstructured
  optical fibers (MOFs). Experimental results on various fabricated solid and MOFs
  are presented that demonstrate the widespread applicability and high accuracy of
  the proposed technique, which should prove to be an invaluable tool for designing
  novel optical fibers with tailored Brillouin response for a wide range of applications.
