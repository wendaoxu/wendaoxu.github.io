 abstract = {We describe a polarization-maintaining fiber&#x2013;based polarization-sensitive optical low-coherence reflectometer for measurement of depth-resolved birefringence. Unlike for other fiber-based polarization-sensitive optical low-coherence reflectometers, here the linear birefringence of a sample can be measured from data recorded in a single A scan. Simultaneous measurement of retardation and orientation of birefringent axes with mica wave plates is demonstrated. The measured retardation is insensitive to sample rotation in the plane perpendicular to ranging.},
