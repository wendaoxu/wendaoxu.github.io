abstract: We describe a polarization-maintaining fiber&#x2013;based polarization-sensitive
  optical low-coherence reflectometer for measurement of depth-resolved birefringence.
  Unlike for other fiber-based polarization-sensitive optical low-coherence reflectometers,
  here the linear birefringence of a sample can be measured from data recorded in
  a single A scan. Simultaneous measurement of retardation and orientation of birefringent
  axes with mica wave plates is demonstrated. The measured retardation is insensitive
  to sample rotation in the plane perpendicular to ranging.
