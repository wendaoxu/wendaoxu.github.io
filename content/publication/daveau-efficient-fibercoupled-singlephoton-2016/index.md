abstract: Many photonic quantum information processing applications would benefit
  from a high brightness, fiber-coupled source of triggered single photons. Here,
  we present a fiber-coupled photonic-crystal waveguide single-photon source relying
  on evanescent coupling of the light field from a tapered out-coupler to an optical
  fiber. A two-step approach is taken where the performance of the tapered out-coupler
  is recorded first on an independent device containing an on-chip reflector. Reflection
  measurements establish that the chip-to-fiber coupling efficiency exceeds 80 %.
  The detailed characterization of a high-efficiency photonic-crystal waveguide extended
  with a tapered out-coupling section is then performed. The corresponding overall
  single-photon source efficiency is 10.9 % $backslashpm$ 2.3 %, which quantifies
  the success probability to prepare an exciton in the quantum dot, couple it out
  as a photon in the waveguide, and subsequently transfer it to the fiber. The applied
  out-coupling method is robust, stable over time, and broadband over several tens
  of nanometers, which makes it a highly promising pathway to increase the efficiency
  and reliability of planar chip-based single-photon sources.
