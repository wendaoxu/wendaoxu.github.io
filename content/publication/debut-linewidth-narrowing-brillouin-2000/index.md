abstract: The linewidth narrowing observed in Brillouin fiber ring lasers is studied
  within the framework of the usual three-wave model of stimulated Brillouin scattering.
  We show that the phase noise of the pump laser is transferred to the emitted Stokes
  wave after being strongly reduced and smoothed under the combined influence of the
  acoustic damping and the cavity feedback. We then derive a simple analytical relation
  connecting the full width at half maximum of the Stokes linewidth to that of the
  pump laser.
