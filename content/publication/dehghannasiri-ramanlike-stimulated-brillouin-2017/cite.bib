 abstract = {We study theoretically stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides created as a phononic line defect inside a pillar-based phononic-crystal membrane of the same material for efficient confinement of the generated acoustic phonons to the optical waveguides. The phononic defect is carefully designed to confine the transversally resonating breathing acoustic mode inside the phononic band gap of the host phononic crystal. These breathing acoustic modes are well excited by the fundamental optical modes of the waveguides. By optimizing this structure, we show the possibility of achieving high SBS gain in an integrated platform with full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility with other photonic and electronic functionalities. The combination of low-loss traveling photons and long-lasting resonating phonons in the proposed SiN waveguide paves the way for the demonstration of efficient on-chip SBS devices.},
