abstract: We study theoretically stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in silicon
  nitride (SiN) waveguides created as a phononic line defect inside a pillar-based
  phononic-crystal membrane of the same material for efficient confinement of the
  generated acoustic phonons to the optical waveguides. The phononic defect is carefully
  designed to confine the transversally resonating breathing acoustic mode inside
  the phononic band gap of the host phononic crystal. These breathing acoustic modes
  are well excited by the fundamental optical modes of the waveguides. By optimizing
  this structure, we show the possibility of achieving high SBS gain in an integrated
  platform with full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility
  with other photonic and electronic functionalities. The combination of low-loss
  traveling photons and long-lasting resonating phonons in the proposed SiN waveguide
  paves the way for the demonstration of efficient on-chip SBS devices.
