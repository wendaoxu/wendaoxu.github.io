abstract: Optical frequency combs1,2,3 provide equidistant frequency markers in the
  infrared, visible and ultraviolet4,5, and can be used to link an unknown optical
  frequency to a radio or microwave frequency reference6,7. Since their inception,
  frequency combs have triggered substantial advances in optical frequency metrology
  and precision measurements6,7 and in applications such as broadband laser-based
  gas sensing8 and molecular fingerprinting9. Early work generated frequency combs
  by intra-cavity phase modulation10,11; subsequently, frequency combs have been generated
  using the comb-like mode structure of mode-locked lasers, whose repetition rate
  and carrier envelope phase can be stabilized12. Here we report a substantially different
  approach to comb generation, in which equally spaced frequency markers are produced
  by the interaction between a continuous-wave pump laser of a known frequency with
  the modes of a monolithic ultra-high-Q microresonator13 via the Kerr nonlinearity14,15.
  The intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain makes it possible to generate
  discrete comb modes over a 500-nm-wide span ($∼$70 THz) around 1,550 nm without
  relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical-heterodyne-based measurements
  reveal that cascaded parametric interactions give rise to an optical frequency comb,
  overcoming passive cavity dispersion. The uniformity of the mode spacing has been
  verified to within a relative experimental precision of 7.3 × 10-18. In contrast
  to femtosecond mode-locked lasers16, this work represents a step towards a monolithic
  optical frequency comb generator, allowing considerable reduction in size, complexity
  and power consumption. Moreover, the approach can operate at previously unattainable
  repetition rates17, exceeding 100 GHz, which are useful in applications where access
  to individual comb modes is required, such as optical waveform synthesis18, high
  capacity telecommunications or astrophysical spectrometer calibration19.
