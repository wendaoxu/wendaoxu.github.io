abstract: Single sideband optical modulation can be used in multiple RF photonic link
  applications. However, single sideband optical modulation is often thought to provide
  lower RF output power than traditional dual sideband modulation techniques. While
  true in one specific case, it is not true in all cases. We theoretically and experimentally
  analyze the RF performance of a photonic link utilizing a Z-cut dual-electrode Mach-Zehnder
  intensity modulator with a 90$^∘$ RF hybrid that produces optical single sideband
  modulation. The single sideband performance is compared to double sideband modulation
  using the same Mach-Zehnder modulator in either a push-pull configuration using
  a 180$^∘$ RF hybrid or a single-arm drive configuration. The optical sideband powers,
  RF output power and the output intercept power and spur-free dynamic range of the
  third-order intermodulation nonlinearity are compared both theoretically and experimentally
  for each of the three cases. The performance of a double sideband modulated link
  using an X-cut inherently push-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator is also compared theoretically,
  assuming the same V$π$ and insertion loss as the dual-electrode Mach-Zehnder modulator.
