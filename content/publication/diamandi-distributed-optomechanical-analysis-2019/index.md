abstract: The analysis of surrounding media has been a long-standing challenge of
  optical fiber sensors. Measurements are difficult due to the confinement of light
  to the inner core of standard fibers. Over the last two years, new sensor concepts
  have enabled the analysis of liquids outside the cladding boundary, where light
  does not reach. Sensing is based on opto-mechanical, forward stimulated Brillouin
  scattering (F-SBS) interactions between guided light and sound waves. In most previous
  studies, however, the protective polymer coating of the fiber had to be removed
  first. In this work, we report the opto-mechanical analysis of liquids outside commercially
  available, standard single-mode fibers with polyimide coating. The polyimide layer
  provides mechanical protection but can also transmit acoustic waves from the fiber
  cladding toward outside media. The comprehensive analysis of opto-mechanical coupling
  in coated fibers that are immersed in liquid is provided. The model shows that F-SBS
  spectra in coated fibers are more complex than those of bare fibers and strongly
  depend on the exact coating diameter and the choice of acoustic mode. Nevertheless,
  sensing outside coated fibers is demonstrated experimentally. Integrated measurements
  over 100 m of fiber clearly distinguish between air, ethanol, and water outside
  polyimide coating. Measured spectra are in close quantitative agreement with the
  analytic predictions. Furthermore, distributed opto-mechanical time-domain reflectometry
  mapping of water and ethanol outside coated fiber is reported, with a spatial resolution
  of 100 m. The results represent a large step toward practical opto-mechanical fiber
  sensors.
