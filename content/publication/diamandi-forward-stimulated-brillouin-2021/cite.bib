 abstract = {The proper function of protective coating layers is essential for the handling and application of brittle optical fibers. The elastic parameters of polymer coatings can be studied through off-line analysis of test samples. However, the monitoring of these properties on a working fiber during service is challenging. In this work, we use forward stimulated Brillouin scattering processes in standard single mode fibers to measure the acoustic velocity in several types of coating layers. Pump light launches short acoustic pulses outward from the core of the fiber. Multiple reflections at the boundaries between cladding and coating, and between coating and air, form a series of delayed acoustic echoes across the core. These echoes are monitored, in turn, by photo-elastic phase modulation of probe light. Data are collected at temperatures between 25--120 $^∘$C. The thermal dependence of the acoustic velocities in several coatings and of the F-SBS resonance frequencies is investigated. Observations are corroborated by calculations. The proposed technique is well suited for research and development of coating materials, production line quality control, reliability studies and preventive maintenance of working fibers.},
