abstract: The proper function of protective coating layers is essential for the handling
  and application of brittle optical fibers. The elastic parameters of polymer coatings
  can be studied through off-line analysis of test samples. However, the monitoring
  of these properties on a working fiber during service is challenging. In this work,
  we use forward stimulated Brillouin scattering processes in standard single mode
  fibers to measure the acoustic velocity in several types of coating layers. Pump
  light launches short acoustic pulses outward from the core of the fiber. Multiple
  reflections at the boundaries between cladding and coating, and between coating
  and air, form a series of delayed acoustic echoes across the core. These echoes
  are monitored, in turn, by photo-elastic phase modulation of probe light. Data are
  collected at temperatures between 25--120 $^âˆ˜$C. The thermal dependence of the acoustic
  velocities in several coatings and of the F-SBS resonance frequencies is investigated.
  Observations are corroborated by calculations. The proposed technique is well suited
  for research and development of coating materials, production line quality control,
  reliability studies and preventive maintenance of working fibers.
