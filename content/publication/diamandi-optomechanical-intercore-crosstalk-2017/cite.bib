 abstract = {Optical fibers containing multiple cores are widely regarded as the leading solution to the optical communications capacity crunch. The most prevalent paradigm for the design and employment of multi-core fibers relies on the suppression of direct coupling of optical power among cores. The cores, however, remain mechanically coupled. Inter-core, opto-mechanical cross-talk, among cores that are otherwise optically isolated from one another, is shown in this work for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Light in one core stimulates guided acoustic modes of the entire fiber cladding. These modes, in turn, induce refractive index perturbations that extend across to other cores. Unlike corresponding processes in standard fiber, light waves in off-axis cores stimulate general torsional--radial guided acoustic modes of the cylindrical cross section. Hundreds of such modes give rise to inter-core cross-phase modulation, with broad spectra that are quasi-continuous up to 1 GHz frequency. Inter-core cross-talk in a commercial, seven-core fiber is studied in both analysis and experiment. Opto-mechanical cross-talk is quantified in terms of an equivalent nonlinear coefficient, per acoustic mode or per frequency. The nonlinear coefficient may reach 1.9[W&#x00D7;km]&#x2212;1, a value that is comparable with that of the intra-core Kerr effect in the same fiber.},
