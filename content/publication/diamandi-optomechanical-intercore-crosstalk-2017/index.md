abstract: Optical fibers containing multiple cores are widely regarded as the leading
  solution to the optical communications capacity crunch. The most prevalent paradigm
  for the design and employment of multi-core fibers relies on the suppression of
  direct coupling of optical power among cores. The cores, however, remain mechanically
  coupled. Inter-core, opto-mechanical cross-talk, among cores that are otherwise
  optically isolated from one another, is shown in this work for the first time, to
  the best of our knowledge. Light in one core stimulates guided acoustic modes of
  the entire fiber cladding. These modes, in turn, induce refractive index perturbations
  that extend across to other cores. Unlike corresponding processes in standard fiber,
  light waves in off-axis cores stimulate general torsional--radial guided acoustic
  modes of the cylindrical cross section. Hundreds of such modes give rise to inter-core
  cross-phase modulation, with broad spectra that are quasi-continuous up to 1 GHz
  frequency. Inter-core cross-talk in a commercial, seven-core fiber is studied in
  both analysis and experiment. Opto-mechanical cross-talk is quantified in terms
  of an equivalent nonlinear coefficient, per acoustic mode or per frequency. The
  nonlinear coefficient may reach 1.9[W&#x00D7;km]&#x2212;1, a value that is comparable
  with that of the intra-core Kerr effect in the same fiber.
