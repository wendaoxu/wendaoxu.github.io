abstract: Hybrid plasmonic waveguides, in which light is guided by a combination of
  dielectric and plasmonic confinement, are likely to play a key role in compact nonlinear
  optical devices. Although their absorption loss is considerable, through a small
  device footprint and careful optimization, a significant nonlinear phase shift may
  be achieved. Here, we study the Kerr effect in hybrid plasmonic waveguides by analyzing
  the modal effective area, energy velocity, absorption loss, and a weighted average
  of the constituents&#x2019; nonlinear refractive indices to gain physical insight
  into its behavior. We pinpoint the nonlinear contribution as the predominant factor
  in achieving a large third-order susceptibility and discuss its limitations. By
  providing a deep understanding of hybrid plasmonic waveguides for nonlinear applications,
  we indicate pathways for their future optimization.
