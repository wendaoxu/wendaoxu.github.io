 abstract = {We show that adiabatic down-conversion can be made the dominant four-wave mixing process in an anti-resonant hollow-core fiber for nearly a full octave of mid-infrared bandwidth with energy exceeding 10&#x00A0;&#x03BC;J, allowing the generation of energetic and shapeable two-cycle pulses. A numerical study of a tapered fiber with an applied gas pressure gradient predicts the efficient conversion of a 770&#x2013;860&#x00A0;nm near-infrared frequency band to 3&#x2013;5&#x00A0;&#x03BC;m, while a linear transfer function allows pre-conversion pulse shaping and simple dispersion management. Our proposed system may prove to be useful in diverse research topics employing nonlinear spectroscopy or strong light&#x2013;matter interactions.},
