abstract: We show that adiabatic down-conversion can be made the dominant four-wave
  mixing process in an anti-resonant hollow-core fiber for nearly a full octave of
  mid-infrared bandwidth with energy exceeding 10&#x00A0;&#x03BC;J, allowing the generation
  of energetic and shapeable two-cycle pulses. A numerical study of a tapered fiber
  with an applied gas pressure gradient predicts the efficient conversion of a 770&#x2013;860&#x00A0;nm
  near-infrared frequency band to 3&#x2013;5&#x00A0;&#x03BC;m, while a linear transfer
  function allows pre-conversion pulse shaping and simple dispersion management. Our
  proposed system may prove to be useful in diverse research topics employing nonlinear
  spectroscopy or strong light&#x2013;matter interactions.
