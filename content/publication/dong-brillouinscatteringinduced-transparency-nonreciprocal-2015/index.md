abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering is a fundamental interaction between light
  and travelling acoustic waves and arises primarily from electrostriction and photoelastic
  effects, with an interaction strength several orders of magnitude greater than that
  of other relevant non-linear optical processes. Here we report an experimental demonstration
  of Brillouin-scattering-induced transparency in a high-quality whispering-gallery-mode
  optical microresonantor. The triply resonant Stimulated Brillouin scattering process
  underlying the Brillouin-scattering-induced transparency greatly enhances the light--acoustic
  interaction, enabling the storage of light as a coherent, circulating acoustic wave
  with a lifetime up to 10,$Î¼$s. Furthermore, because of the phase-matching requirement,
  a circulating acoustic wave can only couple to light with a given propagation direction,
  leading to non-reciprocal light storage and retrieval. These unique features establish
  a new avenue towards integrated all-optical switching with low-power consumption,
  optical isolators and circulators.
