abstract: Leakage channel fibers, where few air holes form a core, can be precisely
  engineered to create large leakage loss for higher-order modes, while maintaining
  negligible transmission loss for the fundamental mode. This unique property can
  be used for designing optical fibers with large effective area, which supports robust
  fundamental mode propagation. The large air holes in the design also enable the
  optical fibers to be bend resistant. The principles of design and operation regime
  are outlined, demonstrating the potential of this approach for optical fibers that
  propagate a fundamental mode in core diameter exceeding 100 $Î¼$m. Performance of
  a fabricated passive leakage channel fiber, an ytterbium-doped double-clad leakage
  channel fiber, and an ytterbium-doped polarization-maintaining double-clad leakage
  channel fiber are also discussed.
