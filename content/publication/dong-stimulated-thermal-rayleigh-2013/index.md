abstract: Recently, mode instability was observed in optical fiber lasers at high
  powers, severely limiting power scaling for single-mode outputs. Some progress has
  been made towards understanding the underlying physics. A thorough understanding
  of the effect is critical for continued progress of this very important technology
  area. Mode instability in optical fibers is, in fact, a manifestation of stimulated
  thermal Rayleigh scattering. In this work, a quasi-closed-form solution for the
  nonlinear coupling coefficient is found for stimulated thermal Rayleigh scattering
  in optical fibers. The results help to significantly improve understanding of mode
  instability.
