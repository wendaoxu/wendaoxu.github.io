 abstract = {A nonlinear device for ultrafast processing is proposed. This device is based on the nonlinear propagation in a waveguide loop formed by connecting the output ports of a conventional coupler. The device is shown to have potentially useful characteristics for unequal coupling ratios and has the ability to operate on entire pulses when soliton effects are included.},
