abstract: A nonlinear device for ultrafast processing is proposed. This device is
  based on the nonlinear propagation in a waveguide loop formed by connecting the
  output ports of a conventional coupler. The device is shown to have potentially
  useful characteristics for unequal coupling ratios and has the ability to operate
  on entire pulses when soliton effects are included.
