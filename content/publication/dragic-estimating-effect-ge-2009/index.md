abstract: We estimate the effect of Ge doping on the acoustic damping coefficient
  of silica fibers. We show that an acoustically multimode fiber with a characteristic
  central index dip, such as that observed in modified chemical-vapor deposition (MCVD)-type
  fibers, can provide adequate data for a reasonable estimation. This may result from
  the fact that the scattering integral of each acoustic mode in such a waveguide
  is strongly position-dependent in the radial direction where there is a varying
  Ge content.
