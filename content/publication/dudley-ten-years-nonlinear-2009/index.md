abstract: The year 2009 marks the tenth anniversary of the first report of white-light
  supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibre. This result had a tremendous
  impact on the field of nonlinear fibre optics and continues to open up new horizons
  in photonic science. Here we provide a concise and critical summary of the current
  state of nonlinear optics in photonic crystal fibre, identifying some of the most
  important and interesting recent developments in the field. We also discuss several
  emerging research directions and point out links with other areas of physics that
  are now becoming apparent.
