abstract: Submicron scale structures with high index contrast are key to compact structures
  for realizing photonic integrated structures. Ultra-compact optical devices in silicon-on-insulator
  (SOI) substrates serve compatibility with semiconductor fabrication technology leading
  to reduction of cost and mass production. Photonic crystal structures possess immense
  potential for realizing various compact optical devices. However, coupling light
  to photonic crystal waveguide structures is crucial in order to achieve strong transmission
  and wider bandwidth of signal. Widening of bandwidth will increase potential for
  various applications and high transmission will make easy signal detection at the
  output. In this paper, the techniques reported so far for coupling light in photonic
  crystal waveguides have been reviewed and analyzed so that a comprehensive guide
  for an efficient coupling to photonic crystal waveguides can be made possible.
