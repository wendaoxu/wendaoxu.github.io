abstract: A recent renaissance in Brillouin scattering research has been driven by
  the increasing maturity of photonic integration platforms and nanophotonics. The
  result is a new breed of chip-based devices that exploit acousto-optic interactions
  to create lasers, amplifiers, filters, delay lines and isolators. Here, we provide
  a detailed overview of Brillouin scattering in integrated waveguides and resonators,
  covering key concepts such as the stimulation of the Brillouin process, in which
  the optical field itself induces acoustic vibrations, the importance of acoustic
  confinement, methods for calculating and measuring Brillouin gain, and the diversity
  of materials platforms and geometries. Our Review emphasizes emerging applications
  in microwave photonics, signal processing and sensing, and concludes with a perspective
  for future directions.
