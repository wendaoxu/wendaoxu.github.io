 abstract = {The unique and striking material properties of chalcogenide glasses have been studied for decades, providing applications in the electronics industry, imaging and more recently in photonics. This Review summarizes progress in photonic devices that exploit the unique optical properties of chalcogenide glasses for a range of important applications, focusing on recent examples in mid-infrared sensing, integrated optics and ultrahigh-bandwidth signal processing.},
