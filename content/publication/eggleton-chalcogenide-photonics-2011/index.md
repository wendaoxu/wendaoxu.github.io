abstract: The unique and striking material properties of chalcogenide glasses have
  been studied for decades, providing applications in the electronics industry, imaging
  and more recently in photonics. This Review summarizes progress in photonic devices
  that exploit the unique optical properties of chalcogenide glasses for a range of
  important applications, focusing on recent examples in mid-infrared sensing, integrated
  optics and ultrahigh-bandwidth signal processing.
