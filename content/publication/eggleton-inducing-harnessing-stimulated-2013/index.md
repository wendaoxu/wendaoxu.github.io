abstract: We review recent progress in inducing and harnessing stimulated Brillouin
  scattering (SBS) in integrated photonic circuits. Exciting SBS in a chip-scale device
  is challenging due to the stringent requirements on materials and device geometry.
  We discuss these requirements, which include material parameters, such as optical
  refractive index and acoustic velocity, and device properties, such as acousto-optic
  confinement. Recent work on SBS in nano-photonic waveguides and micro-resonators
  is presented, with special attention paid to photonic integration of applications
  such as narrow-linewidth lasers, slow- and fast-light, microwave signal processing,
  Brillouin dynamic gratings, and nonreciprocal devices.
