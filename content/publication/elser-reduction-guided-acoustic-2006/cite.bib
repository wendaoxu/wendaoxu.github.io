 abstract = {Guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) generates phase and polarization noise of light propagating in glass fibers. This excess noise affects the performance of various experiments operating at the quantum noise limit. We experimentally demonstrate the reduction of GAWBS noise in a photonic crystal fiber in a broad frequency range by tailoring the acoustic modes using the photonic also as a phononic crystal. We compare the noise spectrum to the one of a standard fiber and observe a tenfold noise reduction in the frequency range up to 200 MHz. Based on our measurement results as well as on numerical simulations, we establish a model for the reduction of GAWBS noise in photonic crystal fibers.},
