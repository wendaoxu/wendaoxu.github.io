abstract: Guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) generates phase and polarization
  noise of light propagating in glass fibers. This excess noise affects the performance
  of various experiments operating at the quantum noise limit. We experimentally demonstrate
  the reduction of GAWBS noise in a photonic crystal fiber in a broad frequency range
  by tailoring the acoustic modes using the photonic also as a phononic crystal. We
  compare the noise spectrum to the one of a standard fiber and observe a tenfold
  noise reduction in the frequency range up to 200 MHz. Based on our measurement results
  as well as on numerical simulations, we establish a model for the reduction of GAWBS
  noise in photonic crystal fibers.
