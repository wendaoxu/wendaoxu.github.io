abstract: Acoustic modes propagating in cylindrical solid rods are considered. A review
  of the properties of several mode groups is given, and computed results are shown
  for a wide range of material properties. The lower mode of each group is relevant
  for an all-fiber-optic frequency shifter recently demonstrated. For these modes,
  dispersion relations, mode patterns, power relations, and acoustooptic coupling
  strength are calculated. Some experimental results are compared with the calculations,
  and alterations to improve the frequency shifter are proposed.$<>$
