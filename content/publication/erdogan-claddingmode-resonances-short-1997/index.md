abstract: The transmission of a mode guided by the core of an optical fiber through
  an ultraviolet-induced fiber grating when substantial coupling to cladding modes
  occurs is analyzed both experimentally and theoretically. A straightforward theory
  is presented that is based on the calculation of the modes of a three-layer step-index
  fiber geometry and on multimode coupled-mode theory that accurately models the measured
  transmission in gratings that support both counterpropagating (short-period) and
  co-propagating (long-period) interactions. These cladding-mode resonance filters
  promise unique applications for spectral filtering and sensing.
