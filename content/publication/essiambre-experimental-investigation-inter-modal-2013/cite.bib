 abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate nondegenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) between waves belonging to different spatial modes of a 5-km-long few-mode fiber (FMF). Of the three inter-modal FWM (IM-FWM) processes possible, two have been experimentally observed. These IM-FWM processes are found to be phase-matched over very large frequency separations of several Terahertz between the waves. In contrast to FWM in single-mode fibers that require operating near the zero-dispersion wavelength to achieve phase matching, IM-FWM in a FMF can be fully phase matched in the presence of large chromatic dispersion in each spatial mode.},
