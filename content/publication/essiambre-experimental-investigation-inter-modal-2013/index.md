abstract: We experimentally demonstrate nondegenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) between
  waves belonging to different spatial modes of a 5-km-long few-mode fiber (FMF).
  Of the three inter-modal FWM (IM-FWM) processes possible, two have been experimentally
  observed. These IM-FWM processes are found to be phase-matched over very large frequency
  separations of several Terahertz between the waves. In contrast to FWM in single-mode
  fibers that require operating near the zero-dispersion wavelength to achieve phase
  matching, IM-FWM in a FMF can be fully phase matched in the presence of large chromatic
  dispersion in each spatial mode.
