abstract: An all-fiber wavelength-division multiplexer (WDM) based on the nonreciprocity
  of the birefringence to the polarization states is proposed. The transfer function
  of a Sagnac interferometer is wavelength dependent if the loop birefringence of
  the interferometer consists of both circular and linear parts. Theoretical analysis
  shows that the output characteristics of this WDM are similar to those of a fiber
  taper-based device. Both the bandwidth and the peak wavelength of the new WDM can
  be tuned by changing the loop birefringence. Experimental prototypes exhibit a channel
  isolation greater than 25 dB with peak passband insertion loss of less than 1 dB.
