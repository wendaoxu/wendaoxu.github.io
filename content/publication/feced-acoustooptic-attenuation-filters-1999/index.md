abstract: This paper studies the acoustooptic interaction induced by an acoustic flexural
  wave among the optical propagation modes supported by tapered optical fibers. We
  have investigated the evolution of the acoustooptic resonance condition as the fiber
  is progressively tapered, showing that the taper radius can be regarded as a new
  degree of freedom in the design of acoustooptic filters. Finally, we demonstrate
  a novel acoustooptic filter based on nonuniform tapers for dynamic gain flattening
  of optical fiber amplifiers.
