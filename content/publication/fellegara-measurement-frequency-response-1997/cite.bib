 abstract = {Accurate measurements of the frequency response of the nonlinear refractive index induced by the combined effects of Kerr nonlinearity with electrostrictional excitation of acoustic waves in optical fibers are presented. A detailed experimental investigation of both standard (zero-dispersion wavelength, $łambda$0$≈$1.31 \textmum) and dispersion-shifted ($łambda$0=1.55 \textmum) single-mode fibers showed the presence of several resonant peaks induced by the electrostrictive nonlinearity in the fiber structure. This investigation has provided better insight into the frequency behavior of the electrostriction-induced acoustic waves in optical fibers.},
