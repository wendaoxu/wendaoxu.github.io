abstract: Accurate measurements of the frequency response of the nonlinear refractive
  index induced by the combined effects of Kerr nonlinearity with electrostrictional
  excitation of acoustic waves in optical fibers are presented. A detailed experimental
  investigation of both standard (zero-dispersion wavelength, $łambda$0$≈$1.31 textmum)
  and dispersion-shifted ($łambda$0=1.55 textmum) single-mode fibers showed the presence
  of several resonant peaks induced by the electrostrictive nonlinearity in the fiber
  structure. This investigation has provided better insight into the frequency behavior
  of the electrostriction-induced acoustic waves in optical fibers.
