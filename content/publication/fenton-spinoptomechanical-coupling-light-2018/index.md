abstract: Light that carries linear or angular momentum can interact with a mechanical
  object, giving rise to optomechanical effects. In particular, a photon can transfer
  its intrinsic angular momentum to an object when the object either absorbs the photon
  or changes the photon polarization, as in an action/reaction force pair. Here, we
  demonstrate resonant driving of torsional mechanical modes of a single-mode tapered
  optical nanofiber using spin angular momentum. The nanofiber torsional mode spectrum
  is characterized by polarimetry, showing narrow natural resonances (Q&#x2248;2,000).
  By sending amplitude-modulated light through the nanofiber, we resonantly drive
  individual torsional modes as a function of the light polarization. By varying the
  input polarization to the fiber, we find the largest amplification of a mechanical
  oscillation (&gt;35&#x2009;&#x2009;dB) is observed when driving the system with
  light containing longitudinal spin on the nanofiber waist. These results present
  optical nanofibers as a platform suitable for quantum spin-optomechanics experiments.
