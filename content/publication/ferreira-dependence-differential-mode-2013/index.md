abstract: This paper presents the design of few-mode fibers (FMFs) with low differential
  mode delay (DMD) over the C-band, considering a refractive index profile with a
  graded core and a cladding trench. By optimizing the core grading exponent and the
  dimensioning of the trench, the lowest DMD achievable is obtained for different
  numbers of linearly polarized (LP) modes. Additionally, considering the concatenation
  of two FMFs with profiles of the same type but with different parameters values,
  both profiles are optimized in order to minimize the residual DMD. For both cases,
  the accumulated DMD increase rate with the number of LP modes is presented, as well
  as the maximum distance reach for mode-division multiplexing transmission.
