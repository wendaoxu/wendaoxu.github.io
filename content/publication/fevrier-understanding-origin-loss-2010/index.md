abstract: It is now commonly accepted that, in large pitch hollow-core `kagomé' lattice
  fibers, the loss spectrum is related to resonances of the thin silica webs in the
  photonic crystal cladding. Moreover, coherent scattering from successive holes'
  layers cannot be obtained and adding holes' layers does not decrease the loss level.
  In this communication, cross-comparison of experimental data and accurate numerical
  modeling is presented that helps demonstrate that waveguiding in large pitch hollow-core
  fibers arises from the antiresonance of the core surround only and does not originate
  from the photonic crystal cladding. The glass webs only mechanically support the
  core surround and are sources of extra leakage. Large pitch hollow-core fibers exhibit
  features of thin walled and thick walled tubular waveguides, the first one tailoring
  the transmission spectrum while the second one is responsible for the increased
  loss figure. As a consequence, an approximate calculus, based on specific features
  of both types of waveguides, gives the loss spectrum, in very good agreement with
  experimental data. Finally, a minimalist hollow-core microstructured fiber, the
  cladding of which consists of six thin bridges suspending the core surround, is
  proposed for the first time.
