abstract: We report the experimental demonstration of storing optical information
  as a mechanical excitation in a silica optomechanical resonator. We use writing
  and readout laser pulses tuned to one mechanical frequency below an optical cavity
  resonance to control the coupling between the mechanical displacement and the optical
  field at the cavity resonance. The writing pulse maps a signal pulse at the cavity
  resonance to a mechanical excitation. The readout pulse later converts the mechanical
  excitation back to an optical pulse. The storage lifetime is determined by the relatively
  long damping time of the mechanical excitation.
