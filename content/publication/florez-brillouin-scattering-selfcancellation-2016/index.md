abstract: 'The interaction between light and acoustic phonons is strongly modified
  in sub-wavelength confinement, and has led to the demonstration and control of Brillouin
  scattering in photonic structures such as nano-scale optical waveguides and cavities.
  Besides the small optical mode volume, two physical mechanisms come into play simultaneously:
  a volume effect caused by the strain-induced refractive index perturbation (known
  as photo-elasticity), and a surface effect caused by the shift of the optical boundaries
  due to mechanical vibrations. As a result, proper material and structure engineering
  allows one to control each contribution individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
  the perfect cancellation of Brillouin scattering arising from Rayleigh acoustic
  waves by engineering a silica nanowire with exactly opposing photo-elastic and moving-boundary
  effects. This demonstration provides clear experimental evidence that the interplay
  between the two mechanisms is a promising tool to precisely control the photon--phonon
  interaction, enhancing or suppressing it.'
