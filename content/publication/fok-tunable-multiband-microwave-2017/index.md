abstract: The increasing demand for multifunctional devices, the use of cognitive
  wireless technology to solve the frequency resource shortage problem, as well as
  the capabilities and operational flexibility necessary to meet ever-changing environment
  result in an urgent need of multiband wireless communications. Spectral filter is
  an essential part of any communication systems, and in the case of multiband wireless
  communications, tunable multiband RF filters are required for channel selection,
  noise/interference removal, and RF signal processing. Unfortunately, it is difficult
  for RF electronics to achieve both tunable and multiband spectral filtering. Recent
  advancements of microwave photonics have proven itself to be a promising candidate
  to solve various challenges in RF electronics including spectral filtering, however,
  the development of multiband microwave photonic filtering still faces lots of difficulties,
  due to the limited scalability and tunability of existing microwave photonic schemes.
  In this review paper, we first discuss the challenges that were facing by multiband
  microwave photonic filter, then we review recent techniques that have been developed
  to tackle the challenge and lead to promising developments of tunable microwave
  photonic multiband filters. The successful design and implementation of tunable
  microwave photonic multiband filter facilitate the vision of dynamic multiband wireless
  communications and radio frequency signal processing for commercial, defense, and
  civilian applications.
