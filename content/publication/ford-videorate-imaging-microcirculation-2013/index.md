abstract: Oblique back-illumination microscopy (OBM) is a new technique for simultaneous,
  independent measurements of phase gradients and absorption in thick scattering tissues
  based on widefield imaging. To date, OBM has been used with sequential camera exposures,
  which reduces temporal resolution, and can produce motion artifacts in dynamic samples.
  Here, a variation of OBM that allows single-exposure operation with wavelength multiplexing
  and image splitting with a Wollaston prism is introduced. Asymmetric anamorphic
  distortion induced by the prism is characterized and corrected in real time using
  a graphics-processing unit. To demonstrate the capacity of single-exposure OBM to
  perform artifact-free imaging of blood flow, video-rate movies of microcirculation
  in ovo in the chorioallantoic membrane of the developing chick are presented. Imaging
  is performed with a high-resolution rigid Hopkins lens suitable for endoscopy.
