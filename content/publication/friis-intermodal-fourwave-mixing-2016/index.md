abstract: We demonstrate efficient four-wave mixing among different spatial modes
  in a 1-km long two-mode fiber at telecommunication wavelengths. Two pumps excite
  the LP01 and LP11 modes, respectively, while the probe signal excites the LP01 mode,
  and the phase conjugation (PC) and Bragg scattering (BS) idlers are generated in
  the LP11 mode. For these processes we experimentally characterize their phase matching
  efficiency and bandwidth and find that they depend critically on the wavelength
  separation of the two pumps, in good agreement with the numerical study we carried
  out. We also confirm experimentally that BS has a larger bandwidth than PC for the
  optimum choice of the pump wavelength separation.
