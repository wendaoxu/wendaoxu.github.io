 abstract = {The compact microstrip resonant cell (CMRC) is widely used in the design of filters in microwave circuits. By combining the CMRC and other structures, the researchers proposed a series of filter designs. This article reviews the development of CMRC filter design, and lists four common structures: the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW), multiple-mode resonator (MMR), the coplanar waveguide (CPW), and the defected ground structure (DGS). They can be perfectly combined with the CMRC structure to design a microwave filter with excellent performance.},
