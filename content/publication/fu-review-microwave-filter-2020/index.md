abstract: 'The compact microstrip resonant cell (CMRC) is widely used in the design
  of filters in microwave circuits. By combining the CMRC and other structures, the
  researchers proposed a series of filter designs. This article reviews the development
  of CMRC filter design, and lists four common structures: the substrate integrated
  waveguide (SIW), multiple-mode resonator (MMR), the coplanar waveguide (CPW), and
  the defected ground structure (DGS). They can be perfectly combined with the CMRC
  structure to design a microwave filter with excellent performance.'
