 abstract = {The new design methods of microwave filter has proved its significance for use in wireless communication systems. Modern wireless communication systems require microwave filters to have stringent specifications such as compact size, robust, conformal, light weight and more importantly cost effective while maintaining its electrical characteristics. Micro-strip filter design and reconfigurable filters present a better prospectus in this regards as it meets the specifications of modern wireless communication applications. Reconfigurable filters can provide control over parameters such as frequency, bandwidth and selectivity while reducing the need of number of switches sandwiched between electrical components. Different methods have provided a new dimension for designing microwave filters .In this article, we present a review on design methods for reconfigurable band-pass filters for next generation wireless technologies such as 4G, 5G and IOT.},
