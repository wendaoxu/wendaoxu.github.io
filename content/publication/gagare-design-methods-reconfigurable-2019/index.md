abstract: The new design methods of microwave filter has proved its significance for
  use in wireless communication systems. Modern wireless communication systems require
  microwave filters to have stringent specifications such as compact size, robust,
  conformal, light weight and more importantly cost effective while maintaining its
  electrical characteristics. Micro-strip filter design and reconfigurable filters
  present a better prospectus in this regards as it meets the specifications of modern
  wireless communication applications. Reconfigurable filters can provide control
  over parameters such as frequency, bandwidth and selectivity while reducing the
  need of number of switches sandwiched between electrical components. Different methods
  have provided a new dimension for designing microwave filters .In this article,
  we present a review on design methods for reconfigurable band-pass filters for next
  generation wireless technologies such as 4G, 5G and IOT.
