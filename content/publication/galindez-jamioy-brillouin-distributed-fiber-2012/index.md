abstract: A review focused on real world applications of Brillouin distributed fiber
  sensors is presented in this paper. After a brief overview of the theoretical principles,
  some works to face the two main technical challenges (large dynamic range and higher
  spatial resolution) are commented. Then an overview of some real and on-field applications
  is done.
