abstract: Measurements of birefringence correlation length performed on long single-mode
  telecommunication fibers are reported. The proposed technique relies on the statistical
  properties of the backscattered-field polarization, which was measured by means
  of a polarization-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer. Experimental results
  are reported that show good agreement with the underlying theory based on stochastic
  differential equations.
