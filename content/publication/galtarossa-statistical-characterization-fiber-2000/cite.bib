 abstract = {The statistical properties of the random birefringence that affects long single-mode fibers are experimentally evaluated by means of a polarization-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry. The measurements are in good agreement with theoretical predictions and show, for what we believe is the first time, that the components of the local birefringence vector are Gaussian random variables.},
