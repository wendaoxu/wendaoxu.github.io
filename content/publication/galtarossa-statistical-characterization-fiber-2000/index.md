abstract: The statistical properties of the random birefringence that affects long
  single-mode fibers are experimentally evaluated by means of a polarization-sensitive
  optical time-domain reflectometry. The measurements are in good agreement with theoretical
  predictions and show, for what we believe is the first time, that the components
  of the local birefringence vector are Gaussian random variables.
