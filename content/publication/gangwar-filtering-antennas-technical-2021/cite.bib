 abstract = {Filtering antennas or filtennas realize both antennas and filter functions in a single structure with the sole purpose of reducing losses and size in the design of a radio system. This article presents a comprehensive view of various filtennas design techniques and their types, satisfying the requirements of different wireless communication standards. The codesign and synthesis approaches and multilayer structure, slot/slit, and parasitic elements are the frequently used techniques reported in the literature to date for the filtennas design. The codesign and synthesis approaches need an extra filter in the filtenna's design, thus making it more complex. Whereas multilayer, slot, and parasitic elements do not require additional filters, and help the radio design become compact in size. The individual elements, that is, filter and antenna used in the filtenna are designed by cutting slots, stacking, resonators, or metamaterial structures. There are two broad categories of filtennas, namely, planar and nonplanar. Most of the papers covered in this article are planar, whereas, under the nonplanar category, horn filtennas are analyzed. Performance in each case is compared in terms of size, complexity, and cost. Considering filtennas frequency of operation, they are classified as a single band, multiband, ultra-wideband, and their MIMO configurations are analyzed to improve the reliability of the wireless radio system. Finally, various types of filtennas are compared, and the design guidelines are elaborated, mainly focusing on their application aspect to achieve more compact radio design solutions. The different techniques related to designing filtennas have been compared, and their glance details are provided for a more realistic assessment of individual techniques used till date. Thus, the authors believe that this review article presents a helpful guiding platform for researchers working on filtenna design.},
