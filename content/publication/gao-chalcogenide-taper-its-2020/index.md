abstract: The nonlinear coefficient of chalcogenide glass is 200--1000 times larger
  than that of silica glass, and it is transparent in the 1--15~$Î¼$m wavelength windows,
  which makes the nonlinear effects happen at much low power with a short length in
  near- and mid-infrared wavelength window. With tapered chalcogenide fibers, the
  power density in the core and the waveguide nonlinearity can be enhanced to make
  nonlinear signal processing unit at a compact size. The threshold of Raman scattering
  and supercontinuum generation is reduced due to the enhanced Kerr effect and enhanced
  optical power intensity. Phase-matching condition required in four-wave mixing (FWM)
  can be realized by tailoring fiber structures to engineer the chromatic dispersion,
  which enables new wavelengths creation over a large range at mW power and sub-meter
  length. The guided acoustic waves and longitudinal acoustic waves can be generated
  and detected in mW power with chalcogenide tapers. The high power density in the
  microwires and the high photosensitivity of chalcogenide glass in the 1550~nm band
  enable the inscription of FBGs in the fiber directly. The chalcogenide microwires
  are fragile and the core diameter cannot be tapered down to sub-microns, which can
  be mitigated by polymer coating that can provide mechanical strength. Polymers not
  only provide high mechanical strength as the coating and cladding materials but
  also bring over 10 times larger thermal expansion than chalcogenide cores, which
  enhances the sensor prospect of the chalcogenide fibers for temperature, strain,
  and acoustic sensing. This work reviews the present and emerging trends in investigation
  of chalcogenide tapers, mainly focusing on the fabrication procedure of chalcogenide
  microwires, the nonlinear effects, and sensing applications.
