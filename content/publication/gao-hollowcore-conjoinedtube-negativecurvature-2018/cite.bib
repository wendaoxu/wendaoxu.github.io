 abstract = {Countering the optical network `capacity crunch' requires developments in optical fibres. Here, the authors report a hollow-core fibre with conjoined tubes in the cladding and a negative-curvature core shape. It exhibits a transmission loss of 2\,dB/km at 1512\,nm and less than 16\,dB/km bandwidth in the 1302--1637 nm range.},
