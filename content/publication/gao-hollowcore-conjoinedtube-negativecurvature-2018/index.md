abstract: Countering the optical network `capacity crunch' requires developments in
  optical fibres. Here, the authors report a hollow-core fibre with conjoined tubes
  in the cladding and a negative-curvature core shape. It exhibits a transmission
  loss of 2,dB/km at 1512,nm and less than 16,dB/km bandwidth in the 1302--1637 nm
  range.
