 abstract = {We present a high-performance radio frequency (RF) photonic bandpass filter enabled by combining on-chip Brillouin scattering with a suppressed carrier phase modulation scheme. We achieve a low RF loss of 5 dB and a large stopband rejection of more than 40 dB, which represents a significant improvement of 20 dB to the RF passband gain and 31 dB to the RF rejection ratio over traditional modulation schemes under the same optical power consumption. We further demonstrate filter reconfigurability including multiple passbands, wide frequency (1--20 GHz), and bandwidth tunability (30--350 MHz) without compromising the RF performance.},
