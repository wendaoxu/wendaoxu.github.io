abstract: We present a high-performance radio frequency (RF) photonic bandpass filter
  enabled by combining on-chip Brillouin scattering with a suppressed carrier phase
  modulation scheme. We achieve a low RF loss of 5 dB and a large stopband rejection
  of more than 40 dB, which represents a significant improvement of 20 dB to the RF
  passband gain and 31 dB to the RF rejection ratio over traditional modulation schemes
  under the same optical power consumption. We further demonstrate filter reconfigurability
  including multiple passbands, wide frequency (1--20 GHz), and bandwidth tunability
  (30--350 MHz) without compromising the RF performance.
