 abstract = {We demonstrate an all-fiber high-power single-frequency Brillouin fiber ring laser with maximum power of 100 mW at 1.55 $μ$m, which is actively stabilized by using the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency-locking scheme. Significant reduction ($∼$20 dB) of both relative intensity noise and frequency noise was observed in the Brillouin Stokes radiation as compared with those noises of its pump source, a narrow-linewidth Er-doped fiber laser. Ultranarrow spectral linewidth of the Brillouin fiber lasers was investigated by both delayed self-heterodyne technique and heterodyne beat technique between two independent Brillouin fiber lasers. o̧pyright 2006 IEEE.},
