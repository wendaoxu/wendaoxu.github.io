abstract: We demonstrate an all-fiber high-power single-frequency Brillouin fiber
  ring laser with maximum power of 100 mW at 1.55 $μ$m, which is actively stabilized
  by using the Pound-Drever-Hall frequency-locking scheme. Significant reduction ($∼$20
  dB) of both relative intensity noise and frequency noise was observed in the Brillouin
  Stokes radiation as compared with those noises of its pump source, a narrow-linewidth
  Er-doped fiber laser. Ultranarrow spectral linewidth of the Brillouin fiber lasers
  was investigated by both delayed self-heterodyne technique and heterodyne beat technique
  between two independent Brillouin fiber lasers. o̧pyright 2006 IEEE.
