abstract: An original design of hollow-core photonic crystal fiber composed of a thin
  silica ring suspended in air by six silica struts is proposed. This structure can
  be viewed as a simplified Kagom&#x00E9;-lattice fiber reduced to one layer of air
  holes. By working on the core surround parameters, an efficient antiresonant air
  guiding was successfully demonstrated. Two large low-loss windows (visible/IR) were
  measured with a minimum attenuation less than 0.2 dB&#x221A;m at yellow wavelengths,
  comparable with state-of-the-art designs. The curvature behavior was also studied,
  showing low bending loss sensitivity for the fundamental transmission band. These
  relevant features might open a new route to propose original hollow-core fiber designs
  while making their production simpler and faster than previously.
