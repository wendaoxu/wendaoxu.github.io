abstract: Microwave photonic systems are compelling for their ability to process signals
  at high frequencies and over extremely wide bandwidths as a basis for next generation
  communication and radar technologies. However, many applications also require narrow-band
  $(simtextMHz)$ filtering operations that are challenging to implement using optical
  filtering techniques, as this requires reliable integration of ultra-high quality
  factor $(sim 10textasciicircum8)$ optical resonators. One way to address this challenge
  is to utilize long-lived acoustic resonances, taking advantage of their narrow-band
  frequency response to filter microwave signals. In this paper, we examine new strategies
  to harness a narrow-band acoustic response within a microwave-photonic signal processing
  platform through use of light-sound coupling. Our signal processing scheme is based
  on a recently demonstrated photon-phonon emitter-receiver device, which transfers
  information between the optical and acoustic domains using Brillouin interactions,
  and produces narrow-band filtering of a microwave signal. To understand the best
  way to use this device technology, we study the properties of a microwave-photonic
  link using this filtering scheme. We theoretically analyze the noise characteristics
  of this microwave-photonic link, and explore the parameter space for the design
  and optimization of such systems.
