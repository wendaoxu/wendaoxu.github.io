 abstract = {The growing demand for bandwidth makes photonic systems a leading candidate for future telecommunication and radar technologies. Integrated photonic systems offer ultra-wideband performance within a small footprint, which can naturally interface with fiber-optic networks for signal transmission. However, it remains challenging to realize narrowband ($∼$MHz) filters needed for high-performance communications systems using integrated photonics. In this paper, we demonstrate all-silicon microwave-photonic notch filters with 50× higher spectral resolution than previously realized in silicon photonics. This enhanced performance is achieved by utilizing optomechanical interactions to access long-lived phonons, greatly extending available coherence times in silicon. We use a multi-port Brillouin-based optomechanical system to demonstrate ultra-narrowband (2.7\,MHz) notch filters with high rejection (57\,dB) and frequency tunability over a wide spectral band (6\,GHz) within a microwave-photonic link. We accomplish this with an all-silicon waveguide system, using CMOS-compatible fabrication techniques.},
