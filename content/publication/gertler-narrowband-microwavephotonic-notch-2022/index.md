abstract: The growing demand for bandwidth makes photonic systems a leading candidate
  for future telecommunication and radar technologies. Integrated photonic systems
  offer ultra-wideband performance within a small footprint, which can naturally interface
  with fiber-optic networks for signal transmission. However, it remains challenging
  to realize narrowband ($∼$MHz) filters needed for high-performance communications
  systems using integrated photonics. In this paper, we demonstrate all-silicon microwave-photonic
  notch filters with 50× higher spectral resolution than previously realized in silicon
  photonics. This enhanced performance is achieved by utilizing optomechanical interactions
  to access long-lived phonons, greatly extending available coherence times in silicon.
  We use a multi-port Brillouin-based optomechanical system to demonstrate ultra-narrowband
  (2.7,MHz) notch filters with high rejection (57,dB) and frequency tunability over
  a wide spectral band (6,GHz) within a microwave-photonic link. We accomplish this
  with an all-silicon waveguide system, using CMOS-compatible fabrication techniques.
