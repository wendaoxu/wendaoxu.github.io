abstract: In most practical scenarios, optical susceptibilities can be treated as
  a local property of a medium. For example, in the context of nonlinear optics we
  can typically treat the Kerr and Raman response as local, such that optical fields
  at one location do not produce a nonlinear response at distinct locations in space.
  This is because the electronic and vibrational disturbances produced within the
  material are confined to a region that is smaller than an optical wavelength. By
  comparison, Brillouin interactions, mediated by traveling-wave acoustic phonons,
  can result in a highly nonlocal nonlinear response as the elastic waves generated
  in the process can occupy a region in space much larger than an optical wavelength.
  The unique properties of these interactions can be exploited to engineer new types
  of processes, where highly delocalized phonon modes serve as an engineerable channel
  that mediates scattering processes between light waves propagating in distinct optical
  waveguides. These types of nonlocal optomechanical responses have recently been
  demonstrated as the basis for information transduction, however the nontrivial dynamics
  of such systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we show that the third-order
  nonlinear process resulting from spatially extended Brillouin-active phonon modes
  involves mixing products from spatially separated, optically decoupled waveguides,
  yielding a nonlocal susceptibility. Building on these concepts, we illustrate how
  nontrivial multi-mode acoustic interference can produce a nonlocal susceptibility
  with a multi-pole frequency response, as the basis for new optical and microwave
  signal processing schemes within traveling wave systems.
