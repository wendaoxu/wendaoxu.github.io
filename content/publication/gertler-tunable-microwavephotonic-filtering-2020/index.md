abstract: The ever-increasing demand for high speed and large bandwidth has made photonic
  systems a leading candidate for the next generation of telecommunication and radar
  technologies. The photonic platform enables high performance while maintaining a
  small footprint and provides a natural interface with fiber optics for signal transmission.
  However, producing sharp, narrow-band filters that are competitive with RF components
  has remained challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate all-silicon RF-photonic
  multi-pole filters with $∼$100× higher spectral resolution than previously possible
  in silicon photonics. This enhanced performance is achieved utilizing engineered
  Brillouin interactions to access long-lived phonons, greatly extending the available
  coherence times in silicon. This Brillouin-based optomechanical system enables ultra-narrow
  (3.5 MHz) multi-pole response that can be tuned over a wide ($∼$10 GHz) spectral
  band. We accomplish this in an all-silicon optomechanical waveguide system, using
  CMOS-compatible fabrication techniques. In addition to bringing greatly enhanced
  performance to silicon photonics, we demonstrate reliability and robustness, necessary
  to transition silicon-based optomechanical technologies from the scientific bench-top
  to high-impact field-deployable technologies.
