abstract: We present a wideband and arbitrarily reconfigurable photonic solution to
  RF equalization using the nonlinear optical phenomenon of stimulated Brillouin scattering
  (SBS). In this work, we equalize an RF photonic downconverter with optical signal
  processing to achieve a gain flatness of over 500 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth.
