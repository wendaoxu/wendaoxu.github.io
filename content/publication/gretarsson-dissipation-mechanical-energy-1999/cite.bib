 abstract = {To determine the dissipation induced by the surface of fused silica fibers, we measured the quality factor of fibers having various diameters. We measured a maximum quality factor of 21 million and extrapolated to obtain an intrinsic quality factor for fused silica of 30 million. Dissipation in the surface dominated at diameters less than about 1 mm. We developed a method for characterizing surface-induced dissipation that is independent of sample geometry or mode shape.},
