abstract: To determine the dissipation induced by the surface of fused silica fibers,
  we measured the quality factor of fibers having various diameters. We measured a
  maximum quality factor of 21 million and extrapolated to obtain an intrinsic quality
  factor for fused silica of 30 million. Dissipation in the surface dominated at diameters
  less than about 1 mm. We developed a method for characterizing surface-induced dissipation
  that is independent of sample geometry or mode shape.
