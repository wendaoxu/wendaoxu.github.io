abstract: This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for
  storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as
  the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast
  energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes
  the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental
  techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along
  with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps
  have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular
  importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which
  cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely
  suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents
  a particularly interesting situation, because Bose--Einstein condensation seems
  attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be
  the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole
  traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable
  energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps
  can reveal interesting new phenomena.
