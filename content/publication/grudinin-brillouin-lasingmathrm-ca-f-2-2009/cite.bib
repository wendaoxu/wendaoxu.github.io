 abstract = {Stimulated Brillouin scattering with both pump and Stokes beams in resonance with whispering gallery modes of an ultrahigh Q calcium fluoride resonator is demonstrated for the first time. The resonator is pumped with 1064 nm light and has 3 $μ$W Brillouin lasing threshold. The scattering is observed due to the unique morphology of the resonator reducing the phase mismatch between the optical modes and the hypersound wave.},
