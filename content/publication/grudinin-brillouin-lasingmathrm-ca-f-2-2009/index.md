abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering with both pump and Stokes beams in resonance
  with whispering gallery modes of an ultrahigh Q calcium fluoride resonator is demonstrated
  for the first time. The resonator is pumped with 1064 nm light and has 3 $μ$W Brillouin
  lasing threshold. The scattering is observed due to the unique morphology of the
  resonator reducing the phase mismatch between the optical modes and the hypersound
  wave.
