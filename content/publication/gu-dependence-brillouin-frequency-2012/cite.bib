 abstract = {Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) in a single-mode optical fiber has been measured as a function of both radial and axial strain via the Brillouin optical time domain analysis technique. The effects of the two kinds of strain on the BFS are decoupled by making fiber pretensioned and relaxed while applying pressure. Linear relations have been found between the BFS and both kinds of strain. The radial strain coefficient Cv&#x3B5;(r) is found to be 0.029&#x2009;&#x2009;MHz/&#x3BC;&#x3B5;, and the axial strain coefficient Cv&#x3B5;(a) is 0.053&#x2009;&#x2009;MHz/&#x3BC;&#x3B5;. The result may give impetus to some potential applications of the optical fibers, such as a distributed pressure sensor based on Brillouin scattering.},
