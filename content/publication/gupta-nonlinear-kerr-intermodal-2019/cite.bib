 abstract = {We represent the effect of nonlinear propagation in mode-division multiplexed multimode fiber (MMF) link. The effect of intermodal four-wave mixing (IMFWM) and intramodal FWM for waves with different spatial modes (LP01, LP02, LP11, and LP12) over MMF has been analyzed with the help of an optical spectrum analyzer using VPI Photonics/VPI transmission Maker™ version 9.7 simulator. It can be concluded that high launch power and low dispersion generated sidebands in the cases of both intermodal and intramodal FWM. These FWM products grow in number with variation in wavelength of probe as well as these products grow toward the central pump frequency of that particular mode. It mathematically represents the multimode nonlinear propagation of different mode groups (containing N spatial modes in each group) in MMF due to Kerr effect. Thus, nonlinear interaction between modes results in interference that degrades the performance of multichannel mode-division multiplexed systems. To achieve full-phase matching and reduce the effect of IMFWM, chromatic dispersion has been increased in each spatial mode throughout the link.},
