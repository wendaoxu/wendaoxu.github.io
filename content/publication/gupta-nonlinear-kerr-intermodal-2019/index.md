abstract: We represent the effect of nonlinear propagation in mode-division multiplexed
  multimode fiber (MMF) link. The effect of intermodal four-wave mixing (IMFWM) and
  intramodal FWM for waves with different spatial modes (LP01, LP02, LP11, and LP12)
  over MMF has been analyzed with the help of an optical spectrum analyzer using VPI
  Photonics/VPI transmission Makerâ„¢ version 9.7 simulator. It can be concluded that
  high launch power and low dispersion generated sidebands in the cases of both intermodal
  and intramodal FWM. These FWM products grow in number with variation in wavelength
  of probe as well as these products grow toward the central pump frequency of that
  particular mode. It mathematically represents the multimode nonlinear propagation
  of different mode groups (containing N spatial modes in each group) in MMF due to
  Kerr effect. Thus, nonlinear interaction between modes results in interference that
  degrades the performance of multichannel mode-division multiplexed systems. To achieve
  full-phase matching and reduce the effect of IMFWM, chromatic dispersion has been
  increased in each spatial mode throughout the link.
