 abstract = {Silicon nitride (Si3⁢N4) has emerged as a promising material for integrated nonlinear photonics and has been used for broadband soliton microcombs and low-pulse-energy supercontinuum generation. Therefore, understanding all nonlinear optical properties of Si3⁢N4 is important. So far, only stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) has not yet been reported. Here we observe, for the first time, backward SBS in fully cladded Si3⁢N4 waveguides. The Brillouin gain spectrum exhibits an unusual multipeak structure resulting from hybridization with high-overtone bulk acoustic resonances of the silica cladding. The reported intrinsic Si3⁢N4 Brillouin gain at 25 GHz is estimated as 4×10-13 m/W. Moreover, the magnitude of the Si3⁢N4 photoelastic constant is estimated as \textbar$p$12\textbar=0.047\textpm0.004, which is nearly 6 times smaller than for silica. Since SBS imposes an optical power limitation for waveguides, our results explain the capability of Si3⁢N4 to handle high optical power, central for integrated nonlinear photonics.},
