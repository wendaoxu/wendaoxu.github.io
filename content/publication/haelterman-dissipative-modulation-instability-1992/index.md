abstract: We investigate the modulational instability in a synchronously pumped nonlinear
  dispersive ring cavity. The infinite-dimensional Ikeda map which describes the evolution
  of the field in the cavity is reduced to a partial derivative equation which allows
  for analytical developments. We show that, owing to the dissipative nature of the
  problem, the physics of modulational instability in the ring is fundamentally different
  from the usual modulational instability in a nonlinear dispersive fiber. In particular,
  we predict the formation of stable temporal dissipative structures for both the
  normal and the anomalous dispersion regime of the fiber.
