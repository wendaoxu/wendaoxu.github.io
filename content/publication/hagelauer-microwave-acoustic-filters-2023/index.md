abstract: This paper reviews the latest developments in microwave acoustic wave devices.
  After an introduction and brief history of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and surface
  acoustic wave (SAW) devices, a review is given for guided SAWs and XBARs - two new
  technologies, which are promising for future 5G applications. Following this, we
  discuss recent simulation techniques, such as 3D finite element method (3D FEM)
  and simulation of nonlinearities, as well as filter synthesis. Next, a review on
  tunable and reconfigurable acoustics is given. Finally, we present the latest developments
  in microwave acoustics for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) operation as well as BAW oscillators.
