abstract: A bandstop-to-bandpass microwave photonic filter (MPF) using a phase-shifted
  fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG) and a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DD-MZM) is
  proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The PS-FBG has an ultra-narrow notch in
  the reflection band. The DD-MZM is employed to generate a phase-modulated or a quasi-single-sideband
  (QSSB) optical signal by controlling the bias voltage. By applying the phase-modulated
  or QSSB signal to the PS-FBG to suppress one sideband, a bandpass or a bandstop
  MPF is implemented. The MPF can be continuously tuned from bandstop to bandpass
  or vice versa by controlling the bias voltage applied to the DD-MZM. The frequency
  tuning can be simply done by tuning the wavelength of the optical carrier. The proposed
  MPF is experimentally evaluated. Continuous tuning from a bandstop to bandpass filter
  with a bandstop rejection as high as 60 dB and frequency tuning with a frequency
  tunable range as large as 10 GHz are demonstrated.
