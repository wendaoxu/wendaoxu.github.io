abstract: "In this paper, the full development and analysis of four models for the
  transversely vibrating uniform beam are presented. The four theories are the Euler--Bernoulli,
  Rayleigh, shear and Timoshenko. First, a brief history of the development of each
  beam model is presented. Second, the equation of motion for each model, and the
  expressions for boundary conditions are obtained using Hamilton's variational principle.
  Third, the frequency equations are obtained for four sets of end conditions: free--free,
  clamped--clamped, hinged--hinged and clamped--free. The roots of the frequency equations
  are presented in terms of normalized wave numbers. The normalized wave numbers for
  the other six sets of end conditions are obtained using the analysis of symmetric
  and antisymmetric modes. Fourth, the orthogonality conditions of the eigenfunctions
  or mode shape and the procedure to obtain the forced response using the method of
  eigenfunction expansion is presented. Finally, a numerical example is shown for
  a non-slender beam to signify the differences among the four beam models."
