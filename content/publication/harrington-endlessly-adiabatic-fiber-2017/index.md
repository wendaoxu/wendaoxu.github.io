abstract: It is well known that a fiber taper&#x2014;an optical fiber whose size varies
  along its length&#x2014;must exceed a certain minimum length to be adiabatic and
  low-loss. In contrast, we show that an optical fiber with a logarithmic refractive
  index profile can be adiabatically tapered over any length, however short. Its mode
  field distribution is independent of the fiber&#x2019;s size and so remains the
  same along a taper. We report an experimental fiber in which tapers shorter than
  2&#x00A0;mm can have losses as low as 0.03&#x00A0;dB. The fiber is compatible with
  standard telecoms fiber but with low bend loss and should have applications where
  it is desirable to make tapered fiber components (such as fused couplers and photonic
  lanterns) as short as possible. The index profile is analogous to the logarithmic
  potential of quantum mechanics.
