abstract: We present empirical formulae that provide dispersion and effective area
  of the fundamental mode in hollow-core antiresonant fibers. The formulae draw on
  the structural parameters of the fiber and allow one to obtain the guiding properties
  over a wide spectral bandwidth, without the need for time consuming numerical simulations.
  The formulae are validated by comparing their results with those obtained using
  the finite-element method. We also analyze the effects of changing the number of
  antiresonant tubes, as well as adding nested elements in the antiresonant tubes
  on the guiding properties.
