abstract: We report an experimental study on the spectral dependence of depolarized
  guided acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) in a silica single-mode fiber
  (SMF) on acoustic impedance of external materials. The GAWBS spectrum was measured
  when the acoustic impedance was changed from 1.51 to 2.00 kg/s&#x00B7;mm2. With
  increasing acoustic impedance, the linewidth increased; the dependence was almost
  linear with an acoustic impedance dependence coefficient of 0.16 MHz/kg/s&#x00B7;mm2.
  Meanwhile, with increasing acoustic impedance, the central frequency linearly decreased
  with an acoustic impedance dependence coefficient of &#x2212;0.07 MHz/kg/s&#x00B7;mm2.
  These characteristics are potentially applicable to acoustic impedance sensing.
