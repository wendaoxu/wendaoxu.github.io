abstract: The maximal storage duration is an important benchmark for memories. In
  quantized media, storage times are typically limited due to stochastic interactions
  with the environment. Also, optical memories based on electromagnetically induced
  transparency (EIT) suffer strongly from such decoherent effects. External magnetic
  control fields may reduce decoherence and increase EIT storage times considerably
  but also lead to complicated multilevel structures. These are hard to prepare perfectly
  in order to push storage times toward the theoretical limit, i.e., the population
  lifetime T1. We present a self-learning evolutionary strategy to efficiently drive
  an EIT-based memory. By combination of the self-learning loop for optimized optical
  preparation and improved dynamical decoupling, we extend EIT storage times in a
  doped solid above 40 s. Moreover, we demonstrate storage of images by EIT for 1
  min. These ultralong storage times set a new benchmark for EIT-based memories. The
  concepts are also applicable to other storage protocols.
