abstract: Frequency offset locking between two Nd:YAG lasers is performed using frequency
  locking with an electrical delay line. The relative frequency instability of the
  offset locking is measured to be 3.5&#x00D7;10&#x2212;12 for an averaging time of
  1&#x00A0;s, which is approximately 77 times smaller than that of the free-running
  case. The frequency instability of the frequency locking is compared to that of
  the phase locking between the two Nd:YAG lasers. Furthermore, a compact solid-state
  laser is frequency locked to an optical frequency comb with a frequency instability
  of 8.2&#x00D7;10&#x2212;11 for an averaging time of 1&#x00A0;s, which is improved
  by approximately 20 times, with respect to the free-running case. The offset-locking
  scheme using a delay line is useful for various applications including a research
  on quantum optics, interferometric measurements, and experiments involving laser
  cooling, such as an optical lattice clock.
