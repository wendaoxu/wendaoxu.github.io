abstract: We present a white-light spectral interferometric technique employing a
  low-resolution spectrometer for measurement of the dispersion of the group and phase
  modal birefringence in an elliptical-core optical fiber over a wide spectral range.
  The technique utilizes a tandem configuration of a Michelson interferometer and
  the optical fiber to record a series of spectral interferograms and to measure the
  equalization wavelengths as a function of the optical path difference in the Michelson
  interferometer, or equivalently, the wavelength dependence of the group modal birefringence
  in the optical fiber. Applying a polynomial fit to the measured data, the wavelength
  dependence of the phase modal birefringence can also be determined.
