abstract: Optical nanofibers (ONFs) provide a rich platform for exploring atomic and
  optical phenomena even when they support only a single spatial mode. Nanofibers
  supporting higher-order modes (HOMs) provide additional degrees of freedom to enable
  complex evanescent field profiles for interaction with the surrounding medium, but
  local control of these profiles requires nondestructive evaluation of the propagating
  fields. Here, we use Rayleigh scattering for rapid measurement of the propagation
  of light in few-mode ONFs. Imaging the Rayleigh scattered light provides direct
  visualization of the spatial evolution of propagating fields throughout the entire
  fiber, including the transition from core&#x2013;cladding guidance to cladding&#x2013;air
  guidance. We resolve the interference between HOMs to determine local beat lengths
  and modal content along the fiber, and show that the modal superposition in the
  waist can be systematically controlled by adjusting the input superposition. With
  this diagnostic we can measure variations in the radius of the fiber waist to below
  3&#xA0;nm in situ using purely optical means. This nondestructive technique also
  provides useful insight into light propagation in ONFs.
