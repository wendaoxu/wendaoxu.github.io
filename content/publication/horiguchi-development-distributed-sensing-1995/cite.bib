 abstract = {This paper reviews the developments of a distributed strain and temperature sensing technique that uses Brillouin scattering in single-mode optical fibers. This technique is based on strain- and temperature-induced changes in the Brillouin frequency shift. Several approaches for measuring the weak Brillouin line are compared.$<>$},
