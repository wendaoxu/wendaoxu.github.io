abstract: This paper reviews the developments of a distributed strain and temperature
  sensing technique that uses Brillouin scattering in single-mode optical fibers.
  This technique is based on strain- and temperature-induced changes in the Brillouin
  frequency shift. Several approaches for measuring the weak Brillouin line are compared.$<>$
