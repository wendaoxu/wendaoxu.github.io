 abstract = {Brillouin frequency shift in a single-mode optical fiber has been measured as a function of tensile strain. The strain coefficient of normalized Brillouin frequency shift C identical to (dv/sub B//d epsilon )/v/sub B/ is found to be 4.4 for silica fibers. This result shows the potential of Brillouin spectroscopy to evaluate tensile strain in the fiber with the strain resolution of about 2*10/sup -4/. The origin of the large strain coefficient is discussed.$<>$},
