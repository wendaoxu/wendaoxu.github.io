abstract: Brillouin frequency shift in a single-mode optical fiber has been measured
  as a function of tensile strain. The strain coefficient of normalized Brillouin
  frequency shift C identical to (dv/sub B//d epsilon )/v/sub B/ is found to be 4.4
  for silica fibers. This result shows the potential of Brillouin spectroscopy to
  evaluate tensile strain in the fiber with the strain resolution of about 2*10/sup
  -4/. The origin of the large strain coefficient is discussed.$<>$
