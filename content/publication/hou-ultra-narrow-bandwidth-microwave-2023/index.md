abstract: In this paper, a novel microwave photonic filter (MPF) based on a single
  longitudinal mode Brillouin laser achieved by parity time (PT) symmetry mode selection
  is proposed, and its unparalleled ultra-narrow bandwidth as low as to sub-kHz together
  with simple and agile tuning performance is experimentally verified. The Brillouin
  fiber laser ring resonator is cascaded with a PT symmetric system to achieve this
  MPF. Wherein, the Brillouin laser resonator is excited by a 5 km single mode fiber
  to generate Brillouin gain, and the PT symmetric system is configured with Polarization
  Beam Splitter (PBS) and polarization controller (PC) to achieve PT symmetry. Thanks
  to the significant enhancement of the gain difference between the main mode and
  the edge mode when the polarization state PT symmetry system breaks, a single mode
  oscillating Brillouin laser is generated. Through the selective amplification of
  sideband modulated signals by ultra-narrow linewidth Brillouin single mode laser
  gain, the MPF with ultra-narrow single passband performance is obtained. By simply
  tuning the central wavelength of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) pumped
  laser to adjust the Brillouin oscillation frequency, the gain position of the Brillouin
  laser can be shifted, thereby achieving flexible tunability. The experimental results
  indicate that the MPF proposed in this paper achieves a single pass band narrow
  to 72 Hz and the side mode rejection ratio of more than 18 dB, with a center frequency
  tuning range of 0--20 GHz in the testing range of vector network analysis, which
  means that the MPF possesses ultra high spectral resolution and enormous potential
  application value in the domain of ultra fine microwave spectrum filtering such
  as radar imaging and electronic countermeasures.
