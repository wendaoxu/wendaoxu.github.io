abstract: Ab Initio calculations, using density functional theory within the AIMPRO
  code, have been performed on bulk diamond and silicon in order to calculate the
  change in the dielectric constant due to strain, and hence the values of the photoelastic
  tensors. A combination of compressive and tensile strain has been applied to two
  atom unit cells of Si and diamond and the tensors relating to p 11 + 2p 12, p 12
  -- 2p 11 and p 44 extracted. Good agreement is found with experimental results for
  absolute values and frequency dependence of the constants for silicon. Results are
  also given for diamond where experimental data is much more limited and scattered.
