 abstract = {Spatial light modulation can be used to address specific fiber modes, as required in mode-division multiplexed systems. We theoretically compare phase-only spatial light modulation to a combination of amplitude and phase spatial light modulation in terms of insertion loss and crosstalk for a fiber supporting 11 LP modes. We experimentally demonstrate selective mode excitation using a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) spatial light modulator configured to as phase and amplitude modulator.},
