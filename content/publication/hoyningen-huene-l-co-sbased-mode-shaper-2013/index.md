abstract: Spatial light modulation can be used to address specific fiber modes, as
  required in mode-division multiplexed systems. We theoretically compare phase-only
  spatial light modulation to a combination of amplitude and phase spatial light modulation
  in terms of insertion loss and crosstalk for a fiber supporting 11 LP modes. We
  experimentally demonstrate selective mode excitation using a Liquid Crystal on Silicon
  (LCoS) spatial light modulator configured to as phase and amplitude modulator.
