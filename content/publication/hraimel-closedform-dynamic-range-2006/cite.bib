 abstract = {A dual-electrode Mach-Zehnder modulator for modulating a single channel or multiple channels in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) radio-over-fiber systems has been studied and analyzed to determine the effect of bias shifting on the dynamic range (DR) of the modulator. A closed-form expression of a realistic DR as a function of systems' parameters and all main sources of noise at the receiver has been derived. The results of the study indicated that the derived computational expression is general and can be applied for a wide range of parametric variations.},
