abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are waves that remain localized even
  though they coexist with a continuous spectrum of radiating waves that can carry
  energy away. Their very existence defies conventional wisdom. Although BICs were
  first proposed in quantum mechanics, they are a general wave phenomenon and have
  since been identified in electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves in air, water waves
  and elastic waves in solids. These states have been studied in a wide range of material
  systems, such as piezoelectric materials, dielectric photonic crystals, optical
  waveguides and fibres, quantum dots, graphene and topological insulators. In this
  Review, we describe recent developments in this field with an emphasis on the physical
  mechanisms that lead to BICs across seemingly very different materials and types
  of waves. We also discuss experimental realizations, existing applications and directions
  for future work.
