abstract: A gas pressure sensor based on Brillouin scattering in a microscaled fiber
  is experimentally demonstrated. The microscaled fiber with a diameter of 1.9 $Î¼$m
  is drawn from a commercial single-mode fiber. A Brillouin spectrum with multipeak
  structure is observed due to the coupling between longitudinal and shear acoustic
  wave caused by strong acoustic index contrast between glass and air. The proposed
  pressure sensor is based on the fact that the Brillouin peak frequency at 8.5 GHz
  and 9 GHz shifts when environment air pressure changes. It exhibits a pressure sensitivity
  of approximately 0.066 MHz/kPa. This device provides a candidate for gas pressure
  measurement. We also measure the temperature response of the spectra. It is found
  that the temperature coefficient is about two times higher than that of the SMF.
  This phenomenon exhibits potential for simultaneous temperature and pressure sensor.
