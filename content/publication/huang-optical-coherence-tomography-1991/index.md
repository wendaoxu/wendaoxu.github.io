abstract: A technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been developed
  for noninvasive cross-sectional imaging in biological systems. OCT uses low-coherence
  interferometry to produce a two-dimensional image of optical scattering from internal
  tissue microstructures in a way that is analogous to ultrasonic pulse-echo imaging.
  OCT has longitudinal and lateral spatial resolutions of a few micrometers and can
  detect reflected signals as small as approximately 10(-10) of the incident optical
  power. Tomographic imaging is demonstrated in vitro in the peripapillary area of
  the retina and in the coronary artery, two clinically relevant examples that are
  representative of transparent and turbid media, respectively.
