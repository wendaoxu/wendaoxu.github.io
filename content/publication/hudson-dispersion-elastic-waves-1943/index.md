abstract: 'The theory of elastic vibrations in solid circular cylindrical rods of
  homogeneous isotropic materials is redeveloped from the general equations of elasticity
  with the following general results: 1. For any mode of vibration the ratio of the
  velocity of any elastic wave traveling along the rod to the velocity c0 of shear
  waves is the same for any two rods whose Poisson ratios are equal and whose ratios
  of circumference to shear wave-length are equal; 2. If the velocity of propagation
  for any particular mode remains less than c0 as the frequency or radius is increased
  indefinitely, this velocity approaches that of Rayleigh surface-waves; 3. If the
  velocity of propagation for any particular mode remains greater than c0 as the frequency
  or radius is increased indefinitely, this velocity approaches c0 in the limit; and
  4. A considerable simplification is introduced into the method of computing dispersion
  curves for any mode. This investigation not only generalizes and extends the work
  of D. Bancroft on elongational waves but further includes the computation of an
  exact table of dispersion curves for the flexural mode of vibration. The dispersion
  curves for magnesium are compared with the experimental results of Shear and Focke.
  Excellent agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for the first elongational
  and flexural branches.'
