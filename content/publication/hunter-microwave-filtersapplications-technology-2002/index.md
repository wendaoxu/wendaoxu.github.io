abstract: This paper describes the development of microwave filter technology from
  an applications perspective. Military applications required wide-band and tunable
  devices for electronic support measures receivers, which led to the development
  of highly selective wide-band waveguide filters, coaxial resonator and suspended-substrate
  multiplexers, and electronically tunable filters. The satellite communications industry
  created demand for low-mass narrow-band low-loss filters with severe specifications
  on amplitude selectivity and phase linearity. These requirements resulted in the
  development of dual-mode waveguide and dielectric-resonator filters, and advances
  in the design of contiguous multiplexers. Cellular communications base-stations
  demanded low-loss high power-handling selective filters with small physical size,
  capable of being manufactured in tens of thousands at a reasonable cost. These demands
  led to advances in coaxial resonator, dielectric resonator, and superconducting
  filters, and also to methods of cost-reduction, including computer-aided alignment.
  Cellular radio handsets have required the manufacture of hundreds of millions of
  extremely small very low-cost filters, still with reasonably low loss and high selectivity.
  This has driven significant advances in integrated ceramic, surface, and bulk acoustic-wave
  active filters and filters using micromachined electromechanical systems.
