 abstract = {Measurements of intrinsic and induced birefringence of optical fibers are performed at 1550 nm using the optical frequency-domain reflectometry technique. The experiment confirms the theoretical analysis, which predicts the appearance of oscillations on the detected Rayleigh backscattering intensity, with periods equal to the polarization beat length L/sub b/ and to L/sub b//2. Polarization mode-coupling length values are obtained from local birefringence and polarization mode dispersion measurements.},
