abstract: Measurements of intrinsic and induced birefringence of optical fibers are
  performed at 1550 nm using the optical frequency-domain reflectometry technique.
  The experiment confirms the theoretical analysis, which predicts the appearance
  of oscillations on the detected Rayleigh backscattering intensity, with periods
  equal to the polarization beat length L/sub b/ and to L/sub b//2. Polarization mode-coupling
  length values are obtained from local birefringence and polarization mode dispersion
  measurements.
