 abstract = {A new all-fiber optic nonreciprocal modulator is proposed by using acousto-optic frequency shifters (FSs). The device is basically a Mach-Zender interferometer with two reciprocal frequency shifters that shift the optical frequency up and down by fa, respectively. A full non-reciprocal phase shift is produced when the coupling ratios of the FSs are changed from 50% to 100%.},
