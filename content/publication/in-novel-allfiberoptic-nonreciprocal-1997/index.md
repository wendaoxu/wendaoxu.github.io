abstract: A new all-fiber optic nonreciprocal modulator is proposed by using acousto-optic
  frequency shifters (FSs). The device is basically a Mach-Zender interferometer with
  two reciprocal frequency shifters that shift the optical frequency up and down by
  fa, respectively. A full non-reciprocal phase shift is produced when the coupling
  ratios of the FSs are changed from 50% to 100%.
