abstract: We investigate optomechanical interactions in anti-resonant hollow-core
  fibers, for the first time. Experiments and corresponding theoretical calculations
  reveal weak optomechanical coupling, which suggests that anti-resonant hollow-core
  fibers are well-suited for noise-sensitive applications.
