 abstract = {Surface acoustic waves (SAW) and associated devices are ideal for sensing, metrology, and hybrid quantum devices. While the advances demonstrated to date are largely based on electromechanical coupling, a robust and customizable coherent optical coupling would unlock mature and powerful cavity optomechanical control techniques and an efficient optical pathway for long-distance quantum links. Here we demonstrate direct and robust coherent optical coupling to Gaussian surface acoustic wave cavities with small mode volumes and high quality factors ($>$105 measured here) through a Brillouin-like optomechanical interaction. High-frequency SAW cavities designed with curved metallic acoustic reflectors deposited on crystalline substrates are efficiently optically accessed along piezo-active directions, as well as non-piezo-active (electromechanically inaccessible) directions. The precise optical technique uniquely enables controlled analysis of dissipation mechanisms as well as detailed transverse spatial mode spectroscopy. These advantages combined with simple fabrication, large power handling, and strong coupling to quantum systems make SAW optomechanical platforms particularly attractive for sensing, material science, and hybrid quantum systems.},
