abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAW) and associated devices are ideal for sensing,
  metrology, and hybrid quantum devices. While the advances demonstrated to date are
  largely based on electromechanical coupling, a robust and customizable coherent
  optical coupling would unlock mature and powerful cavity optomechanical control
  techniques and an efficient optical pathway for long-distance quantum links. Here
  we demonstrate direct and robust coherent optical coupling to Gaussian surface acoustic
  wave cavities with small mode volumes and high quality factors (textgreater105 measured
  here) through a Brillouin-like optomechanical interaction. High-frequency SAW cavities
  designed with curved metallic acoustic reflectors deposited on crystalline substrates
  are efficiently optically accessed along piezo-active directions, as well as non-piezo-active
  (electromechanically inaccessible) directions. The precise optical technique uniquely
  enables controlled analysis of dissipation mechanisms as well as detailed transverse
  spatial mode spectroscopy. These advantages combined with simple fabrication, large
  power handling, and strong coupling to quantum systems make SAW optomechanical platforms
  particularly attractive for sensing, material science, and hybrid quantum systems.
