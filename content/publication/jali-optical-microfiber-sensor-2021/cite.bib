 abstract = {Due to numerous benefits such as geometrical simplicity, compact size, high sensitivity, broad detection range, low noise, and high accuracy, optical devices have attracted a lot of interest for sensing applications. It is critical in a variety of sectors, including cultural relic preservation, warehouse products maintenance, manufacturing process control, semiconductor, agriculture, food production storage, environmental control, health industries, chemical and home improvement. It outperforms its electronic equivalent owing to its capacity to function in tough and demanding situations such as combustible surroundings, greater pressure and temperature levels, and the ability to send signals over long distances without electromagnetic interference. Optical fiber sensors are classified based on their operating principles such as interferometers, fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), resonators and whispering galleries modes (WGM). This paper presents a comprehensive review related to the optical microfiber sensor such as its properties, fabrication techniques, evanescent wave, optical micro resonators and recent study on the application of microfiber towards humidity sensing. This review could be beneficial to help other researchers to gain greater view in the field of optical microfiber sensor.},
