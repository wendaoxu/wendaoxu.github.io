abstract: Due to numerous benefits such as geometrical simplicity, compact size, high
  sensitivity, broad detection range, low noise, and high accuracy, optical devices
  have attracted a lot of interest for sensing applications. It is critical in a variety
  of sectors, including cultural relic preservation, warehouse products maintenance,
  manufacturing process control, semiconductor, agriculture, food production storage,
  environmental control, health industries, chemical and home improvement. It outperforms
  its electronic equivalent owing to its capacity to function in tough and demanding
  situations such as combustible surroundings, greater pressure and temperature levels,
  and the ability to send signals over long distances without electromagnetic interference.
  Optical fiber sensors are classified based on their operating principles such as
  interferometers, fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), resonators and whispering galleries
  modes (WGM). This paper presents a comprehensive review related to the optical microfiber
  sensor such as its properties, fabrication techniques, evanescent wave, optical
  micro resonators and recent study on the application of microfiber towards humidity
  sensing. This review could be beneficial to help other researchers to gain greater
  view in the field of optical microfiber sensor.
