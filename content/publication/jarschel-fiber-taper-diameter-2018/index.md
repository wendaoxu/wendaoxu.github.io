abstract: We propose a fast and non-destructive method to characterize the absolute
  diameter and uniformity of micrometer-scale fiber tapers using a pump and probe
  forward Brillouin scattering setup. The fundamental torsional-radial acoustic mode
  supported by the wire is excited using a pulsed pump laser and oscillates at a frequency
  that is inversely proportional to the taper waist diameter. This standing time-varying
  torsional-radial wave induces polarization modulation on a probe signal, whose spectrum
  structure reveals the sample diameter and its non-uniformity. By comparing our results
  with measurements using scanning-electron microscopy, a relative deviation of 1%
  or less was demonstrated, and diameter non-uniformity of less than 0.5% could be
  detected.
