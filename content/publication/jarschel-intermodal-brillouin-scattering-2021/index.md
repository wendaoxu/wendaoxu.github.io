abstract: We investigate intermodal forward Brillouin scattering in a solid-core photonic
  crystal fiber (PCF), demonstrating efficient power conversion between the HE11 and
  HE21 modes, with a maximum gain coefficient of 21.4 W-1~km-1. By exploring mechanical
  modes of different symmetries, we observe both polarization-dependent and polarization-independent
  intermodal Brillouin interaction. Finally, we discuss the role of squeeze film air
  damping and leakage mechanisms, ultimately critical to the engineering of PCF structures
  with enhanced interaction between high-order optical modes through flexural mechanical
  modes.
