abstract: The multimode evolution, optical losses and wavelength response of non-adiabatic
  micro/nano-fiber (MNF) tapers are numerically simulated using a three-dimensional
  finite-difference beam propagation method. For a non-adiabatic MNF taper, it is
  illustrated that optical losses vary with the transition region length and the optical
  wavelength. We explain how the complicated multimode evolutions result in the complicated
  optical loss and wavelength response properties, especially when the waist diameters
  are large enough to allow much higher-order modes. These results may offer valuable
  references for trapping and guiding cold atoms in atom optics and practical application
  of micro/nano-devices.
