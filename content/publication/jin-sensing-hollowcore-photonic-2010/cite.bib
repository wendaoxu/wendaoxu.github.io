 abstract = {This paper examines the unique properties of hollow-core photonic bandgap fibers and discusses potential sensing applications of such fibers. Guidance of light in air instead of silica reduces the effect of material on light propagation and is advantageous to applications such as fiber gyroscopes. An air--silica microstructure has novel mechanical and thermal properties and can be beneficial to applications such as acoustic pressure sensors. Holey cladding provides extra flexibility for geometry modification through post thermal treatment or selective filling of the air holes and can be exploited for developing novel devices such as in-line polarizers/polarimeters, modal interferometer, wavelength filters and sensors. The confinement of gas and liquid phase materials and optical guided modes simultaneously within the hollow core allows strong light/sample interaction over an extended length and may be useful for the development of highly sensitive gas and liquid sensors.},
