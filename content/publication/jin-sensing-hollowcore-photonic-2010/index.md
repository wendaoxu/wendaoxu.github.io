abstract: This paper examines the unique properties of hollow-core photonic bandgap
  fibers and discusses potential sensing applications of such fibers. Guidance of
  light in air instead of silica reduces the effect of material on light propagation
  and is advantageous to applications such as fiber gyroscopes. An air--silica microstructure
  has novel mechanical and thermal properties and can be beneficial to applications
  such as acoustic pressure sensors. Holey cladding provides extra flexibility for
  geometry modification through post thermal treatment or selective filling of the
  air holes and can be exploited for developing novel devices such as in-line polarizers/polarimeters,
  modal interferometer, wavelength filters and sensors. The confinement of gas and
  liquid phase materials and optical guided modes simultaneously within the hollow
  core allows strong light/sample interaction over an extended length and may be useful
  for the development of highly sensitive gas and liquid sensors.
