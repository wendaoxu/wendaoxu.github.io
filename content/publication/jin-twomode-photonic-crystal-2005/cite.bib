 abstract = {Index-guiding photonic crystal fibers with appropriate structural parameters support the fundamental and second order modes over a practically infinite wavelength range. The polarization principal axes and mode field patterns of the modes can be made stable by having different size air-holes along the orthogonal directions. The potential applications of such two-mode PCFs are discussed.},
