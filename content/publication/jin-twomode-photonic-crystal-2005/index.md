abstract: Index-guiding photonic crystal fibers with appropriate structural parameters
  support the fundamental and second order modes over a practically infinite wavelength
  range. The polarization principal axes and mode field patterns of the modes can
  be made stable by having different size air-holes along the orthogonal directions.
  The potential applications of such two-mode PCFs are discussed.
