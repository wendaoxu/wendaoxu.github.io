abstract: Optical fibers with a logarithmic index profile can provide invariant mode
  field diameters along a tapered fiber, which enables adiabatic mode transitions
  for higher-order mode (HOM) microfibers. A microfiber with a waist diameter of $∼$2
  textmum is fabricated with an insertion loss lower than 0.03 dB for the LP01 and
  0.11 dB for the LP11 mode. The concept of the low loss HOM microfibers can be further
  extended to include more than one fiber and a 2×2 few mode microfiber coupler is
  fabricated/characterized in our experiments. These single or multiple spatial channel
  HOM microfibers are beneficial for various applications, including in particle propulsion,
  atom trapping, optical sensing and space division multiplexed data transmission
  systems.
