abstract: Generation, processing, and sensing of microwave signals using photonic
  technologies offer immunity from electromagnetic interference, allow high-speed
  operation over a wide frequency range, and reduce the overall system weight. Recent
  developments in integrated photonic technologies further increase the attractiveness
  of photonics-based radio frequency (RF) systems. Stimulated Brillouin scattering
  (SBS), due to its inherently narrow bandwidth, wavelength transparent nature, low
  threshold, and bandwidth reconfigurability, has emerged as a potential contender
  for microwave photonic (MWP) generation and signal processing. In this article,
  we present a review of recent developments in the area of SBS-based MWP. We discuss
  different SBS-based techniques for realizing some of the key MWP signal processing
  functionalities such as RF generation, filtering, and true time delay. Implementation
  of these tasks using fiber and on-chip platforms is presented along with the effect
  of system parameters such as dispersion on their performance. Novel architectures
  to mitigate these impairments are discussed.
