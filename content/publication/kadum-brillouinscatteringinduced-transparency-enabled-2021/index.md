abstract: Real-time spectrum sensing is essential to enable dynamic and rapid spectrum
  sharing of unused frequencies to cater the substantial demands of new wireless services
  deploying the existing RF bands. In this paper, we present a novel, real-time spectrum
  sensing approach for widely used RF signals based on Brillouin-scattering-induced
  transparency (BIT). A temporal discrimination of multi-channel input frequencies
  is achieved through the group delay tuning by BIT. By tuning the pump power and
  frequency, the proposed technique is fully reconfigurable and viable for a broad
  range of spectrum sensing. Several experimental illustrations of the time domain
  sensing are presented for two-tone channels with 0.9, 1.8, and 5&#x00A0;GHz frequencies
  to detect the unused spectrum within 3G, 4G, and 5G signals.
