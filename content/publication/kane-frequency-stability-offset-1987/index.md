abstract: The frequency stability of laser-diode-pumped, monolithic Nd:YAG solid-state
  unidirectional nonplanar ring oscillators was studied by heterodyne measurements.
  We obtained cw single-axial- and transverse-mode power of 25 mW at 1064 nm at a
  slope efficiency of 19%. Two independent oscillators were offset locked at 17 MHz
  with frequency fluctuations of less than textpm40 kHz for periods of 8 min.
