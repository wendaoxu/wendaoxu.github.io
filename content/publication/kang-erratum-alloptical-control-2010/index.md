abstract: We report the observation of a novel nonlinear optoacoustic phenomenon,
  that we name forward stimulated interpolarization scattering. When two frequency-offset
  laser signals are colaunched into orthogonally polarized guided modes of a birefringent
  small-core (1.8$μ$m diameter) photonic crystal fiber, a pattern of axially moving
  polarization fringes is produced, with a velocity and spacing that depends on the
  frequency offset. At values of frequency offset in the few-GHz range, the pattern
  of moving fringes can perfectly match the phase velocity and axial wavelength (3.9
  mm) of the torsional-radial acoustic mode tightly guided in the core. An intense
  optoacoustic interaction ensues, leading to efficient nonlinear exchange of power
  from the higher frequency (pump) mode to the orthogonally polarized lower frequency
  (Stokes) mode. A full-vectorial theory is developed to explain the observations.
