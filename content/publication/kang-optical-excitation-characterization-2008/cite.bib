 abstract = {Transverse acoustic resonances at gigahertz frequencies are excited by electrostriction in the few-micrometer-thick waists of low-loss optical fiber tapers of up to 40 cm long. A pump-probe technique is used in which the resonances are excited by a train of optical pulses and probed in a Sagnac interferometer. Strong radially symmetric acoustic resonances are observed and the dependence of their frequencies on taper thickness is investigated. Such easily reconfigurable acousto-optic interactions may have applications in the high-frequency mode locking of fiber lasers.},
