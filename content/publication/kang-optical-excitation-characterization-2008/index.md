abstract: Transverse acoustic resonances at gigahertz frequencies are excited by electrostriction
  in the few-micrometer-thick waists of low-loss optical fiber tapers of up to 40
  cm long. A pump-probe technique is used in which the resonances are excited by a
  train of optical pulses and probed in a Sagnac interferometer. Strong radially symmetric
  acoustic resonances are observed and the dependence of their frequencies on taper
  thickness is investigated. Such easily reconfigurable acousto-optic interactions
  may have applications in the high-frequency mode locking of fiber lasers.
