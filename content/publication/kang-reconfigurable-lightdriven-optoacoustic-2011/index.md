abstract: Dynamic optical isolation with all-optical switching capability is in great
  demand in advanced optical communications and all-optical signal processing systems.
  Most conventional optical isolators rely on Faraday rotation and are realized using
  micro/nanofabrication techniques, but it is not always straightforward to incorporate
  magneto-optical crystals into these compact systems. Here, we report the experimental
  demonstration of a reconfigurable all-optical isolator based on optical excitation
  of a gigahertz guided acoustic mode in a micrometre-sized photonic crystal fibre
  core. This device has remarkable advantages over its passive counterparts, including
  a large dynamic range of isolation, fast switching capability and reversibility,
  which provide new functionality that is useful in various types of all-optical systems.
  Devices based on similar physical principles could also be realized in CMOS-compatible
  silicon on-chip platforms. oÌ§pyright 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights
