abstract: This paper experimentally demonstrates a method for geometrical profiling
  of asymmetries in fabricated thin microfiber tapers with waist diameters ranging
  from $∼$10 to $∼$50,textmum with submicron accuracy. The method is based on the
  analysis of whispering gallery mode resonances excited in cylindrical fiber resonators
  as a result of evanescent coupling of light propagating through the fiber taper.
  The submicron accuracy of the proposed method has been verified by SEM studies.
  The method can be applied as a quality control tool in fabrication of microfiber
  based devices and sensors or for fine-tuning of microfiber fabrication set-ups.
