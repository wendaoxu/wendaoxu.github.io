abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method for measuring the differential
  modal group delay (DMGD) of a few-mode fiber using a Fourier domain mode-locked
  laser (FDML). We use the fast frequency-swept, wavelength-tunable output of the
  FDML in order to perform time domain measurements of interference of the modes,
  which is further postprocessed to extract the DMGD. We demonstrate the measurement
  of DMGD for a commercial two-mode fiber over the C-band. This method is not limited
  by the magnitude of DMGD or the number of modes and is minimally affected by time-dependent
  polarization and mode fluctuations, environmental noise, and spectral resolution
  of instruments.
