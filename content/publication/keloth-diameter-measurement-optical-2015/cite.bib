 abstract = {We demonstrate a method for making precise measurements of the diameter of a tapered optical fiber with a sub-wavelength diameter waist (an optical nanofiber). The essence of the method is to create a composite photonic crystal cavity by mounting a defect-mode grating on an optical nanofiber. The resultant cavity has a resonance wavelength that is sensitive to the nanofiber&#x2019;s diameter, allowing the diameter to be inferred from optical measurements. This method offers a precise, nondestructive, and in situ way to characterize the nanofiber diameter.},
