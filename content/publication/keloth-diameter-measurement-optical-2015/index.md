abstract: We demonstrate a method for making precise measurements of the diameter
  of a tapered optical fiber with a sub-wavelength diameter waist (an optical nanofiber).
  The essence of the method is to create a composite photonic crystal cavity by mounting
  a defect-mode grating on an optical nanofiber. The resultant cavity has a resonance
  wavelength that is sensitive to the nanofiber&#x2019;s diameter, allowing the diameter
  to be inferred from optical measurements. This method offers a precise, nondestructive,
  and in situ way to characterize the nanofiber diameter.
