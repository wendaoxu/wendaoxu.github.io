abstract: We have experimentally studied fundamental mode propagation in few meters
  long, adiabatically tapered step-index fibers with high numerical aperture, core
  diameter up to 117 $Î¼$m (V = 38) and tapering ratio up to 18. The single fundamental
  mode propagation was confirmed by several techniques that reveal no signature of
  higher-order mode excitation. It can be, therefore, concluded that adiabatic tapering
  is a powerful method for selective excitation of the fundamental mode in highly
  multimode large-mode-area fibers. Annular near field distortion observed for large
  output core diameters was attributed to built-in stress due to thermal expansion
  mismatch between core and cladding materials. The mechanical stress could be avoided
  by an appropriate technique of fiber preform fabrication and drawing, which would
  prevent the mode field deformation and lead to reliable diffraction-limited fundamental
  mode guiding for very large core diameters.
