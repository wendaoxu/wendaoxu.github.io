abstract: In this paper, we explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of spontaneous and
  stimulated forward Brillouin scattering. This general treatment incorporates the
  optomechanical coupling produced by boundary-induced radiation pressures (boundary
  motion) and material-induced electrostrictive forces (photoelastic effects), permitting
  straightforward application to a range of emerging micro- and nanoscale optomechanical
  systems. Through a self-consistent fully coupled nonlinear treatment, developed
  within a general Hamiltonian framework, we establish the connection between the
  power spectral density of spontaneously scattered light in forward Brillouin interactions
  and the nonlinear coupling strength. We show that, in sharp contrast to backward
  Brillouin scattering, noise-initiated stimulated forward Brillouin scattering is
  forbidden in the majority of experimental systems. In fact, the single-pass gain,
  which characterizes the threshold for energy transfer in back-scattering processes,
  is negative for a large class of forward Brillouin devices. Beyond this frequent
  experimental case, we explore mechanisms for dispersive symmetry breaking that lead
  to amplification and dynamics reminiscent of backward Brillouin scattering.
