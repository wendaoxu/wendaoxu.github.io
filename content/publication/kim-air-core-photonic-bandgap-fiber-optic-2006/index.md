abstract: We report the demonstration of the first air-core photonic-bandgap fiber
  gyroscope. Because the optical mode in the sensing coil travels largely through
  air, which has much smaller Kerr, Faraday, and thermal constants than silica, far
  lower dependencies on power, magnetic field, and temperature fluctuations are predicted.
  With a 235-m fiber coil, we observe a minimum detectable rotation rate of ~2.7$^∘$/h
  and a long-term stability of ~2$^∘$/h, which are consistent with the Rayleigh backscattering
  coefficient of the fiber and comparable to that measured with a conventional fiber.
