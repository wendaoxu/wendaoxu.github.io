abstract: An all-fiber-optic frequency shifter is demonstrated that uses mode coupling
  between the LP01 and LP11 modes by a traveling acoustic flexural wave guided along
  the optical fiber. The input and output leads of this frequency shifter are single-mode
  fibers. Unity mode-conversion efficiency for cw operation is achieved at 8-MHz frequency
  shift with about 0.25 W of electrical input power. Carrier and image sideband suppression
  of 15 and 35 dB, respectively, are demonstrated.
