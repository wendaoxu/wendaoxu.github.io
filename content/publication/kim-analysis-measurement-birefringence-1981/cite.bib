 abstract = {The local parameters of linear, circular, and elliptical birefringence of backscattered light along a single-mode fiber are analyzed, and the twist--bending-induced elliptical birefringence in an extremely low birefringent single-mode fiber is measured using the backscattering method. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical calculations. For a 130-$μ$m-diameter fiber, twisted by 133$^∘$/m and wound around a drum of 15-cm radius, the induced elliptical birefringence is\textbar\textohm\textbar = 18$^∘$/m at $łambda$ = 904 nm.},
