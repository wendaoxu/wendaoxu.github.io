abstract: The local parameters of linear, circular, and elliptical birefringence of
  backscattered light along a single-mode fiber are analyzed, and the twist--bending-induced
  elliptical birefringence in an extremely low birefringent single-mode fiber is measured
  using the backscattering method. The experimental results are in good agreement
  with the theoretical calculations. For a 130-$μ$m-diameter fiber, twisted by 133$^∘$/m
  and wound around a drum of 15-cm radius, the induced elliptical birefringence istextbartextohmtextbar
  = 18$^∘$/m at $łambda$ = 904 nm.
