abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency provides a powerful mechanism for
  controlling light propagation in a dielectric medium, and for producing slow and
  fast light. Electromagnetically induced transparency traditionally arises from destructive
  interference induced by a non-radiative coherence in an atomic system. Stimulated
  Brillouin scattering of light from propagating hypersonic acoustic waves has also
  been used successfully for the generation of slow and fast light. However, Electromagnetically
  induced transparency-type processes based on stimulated Brillouin scattering were
  considered infeasible because of the short coherence lifetime of hypersonic phonons.
  Here, we report a new Brillouin scattering induced transparency phenomenon generated
  by acousto-optic interaction of light with long-lived propagating phonons in a silica
  resonator. We demonstrate that Brillouin scattering induced transparency is uniquely
  non-reciprocal owing to the propagating acoustic wave and accompanying momentum
  conservation requirement. We also show that Brillouin scattering induced transparency
  enables ultralow-power ultralow-footprint slow-light generation with delay-bandwidth
  product comparable to state-of-the-art stimulated Brillouin scattering systems.
