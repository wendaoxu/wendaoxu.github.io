abstract: We propose and demonstrate a simple and accurate optical fiber modal birefringence
  measurement technique based on a two-segment Lyot-Sagnac fiber interferometer. We
  have conducted accurate measurements for several low birefringence fibers and the
  results are consistent with published data. This measurement method is allowed in
  the birefringence-length product ranging from 10/sup -3/ to 10/sup -6/ m within
  the resolution of the optical spectrum analyzer used.
