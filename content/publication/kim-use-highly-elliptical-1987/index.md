abstract: The four complex, almost degenerate, second-order eigenmodes of a two-mode
  fiber having a circular core are reduced to two nondegenerate, linearly polarized
  second-order eigenmodes with stable-intensity lobe positions in a highly elliptical
  core fiber. Existing two-mode-fiber devices can be improved by this stabilization
  of the second-order modes. Practical sensors employing the two spatial modes as
  the two arms of an interferometer are described. The two arms of an interferometer
  of this type can have the same group delays, while the difference in phase delays
  is large.
