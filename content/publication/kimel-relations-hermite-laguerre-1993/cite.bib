 abstract = {Relations between Hermite (HG) and Laguerre (LG) Gaussian modes are derived. With these, a LG mode is written as a sum of HG modes, and vice versa. These mode relations are derived from addition identities between a Laguerre polynomial and a pair of Hermite polynomials. The addition relations are derived in two appendices. One figure illustrates the contents of a LG mode in terms of HG modes while a second figure shows the translation in the opposite direction.$<>$},
