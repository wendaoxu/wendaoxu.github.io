abstract: Relations between Hermite (HG) and Laguerre (LG) Gaussian modes are derived.
  With these, a LG mode is written as a sum of HG modes, and vice versa. These mode
  relations are derived from addition identities between a Laguerre polynomial and
  a pair of Hermite polynomials. The addition relations are derived in two appendices.
  One figure illustrates the contents of a LG mode in terms of HG modes while a second
  figure shows the translation in the opposite direction.$<>$
