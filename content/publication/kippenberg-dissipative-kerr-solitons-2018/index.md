abstract: "Shrinking optical metrology The ability to generate laser frequency combs---light
  sources comprising equidistant laser lines spanning a large range of wavelengths---has
  revolutionized metrology and precision spectroscopy. The past decade has seen frequency
  combs being generated in optical microresonator circuits, offering the prospect
  of shifting precision metrology applications from the realm of national laboratories
  to that of everyday devices. Kippenberg et al. review the development of microresonator-generated
  frequency combs and map out how understanding and control of their generation is

  Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDLaser frequency combs, which consist of equidistant
  laser lines, have revolutionized time-keeping, metrology, and spectroscopy. Conventional
  optical frequency combs based on mode-locked lasers are still mostly confined to
  scientific laboratories. In recent years, there has been progress in the development
  of optical frequency combs based on compact, chip-scale microresonators (``microcombs''),
  with such microcombs operating in the dissipative soliton regime. Dissipative solitons
  rely on a double balance of nonlinearity and dispersion as well as dissipation and
  gain and are an example of self-organization in driven dissipative nonlinear systems.
  Dissipative temporal solitons are providing the long-sought-for regime of coherent,
  broadband microcomb spectra and in addition provide an experimental setting in which
  to study dissipative soliton physics. Microcombs are now capable of producing coherent,
  octave-spanning frequency combs, with microwave to terahertz repetition rates, at
  low pump power, and in chip-scale devices and have been used in a wide variety of
  applications, owing to bandwidth and coherence provided by the dissipative temporal
  soliton states. ADVANCESUnderlying these recent advances has been the observation
  of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) in microresonators, which represent
  self-enforcing stationary localized solutions of a damped, driven, and detuned nonlinear
  Schrödinger equation, which was originally used to describe spatial self-organization
  phenomena. They correspond to solitons (localized patterns) in ``open'' systems---that
  is, systems that exhibit dissipation. DKSs, opposite to fiber solitons, therefore
  rely on a double balance of nonlinearity and dispersion as well as parametric gain
  and loss and depend on the laser-cavity detuning as a control parameter. Methods
  have been established that enable the reliable generation of such DKSs in a wide
  range of microresonator platforms, including platforms based on silicon nitride
  (Si3N4) that are compatible with photonic integration. In addition, a variety of
  previously unknown and nonanticipated soliton effects have been observed, such as
  soliton crystallization, Raman-Stokes solitons, and previously unseen soliton breather
  dynamics. Moreover, dissipative solitons have been shown to be suprisingly robust
  against imperfections in the resonator mode structure. Dissipative soliton states
  in microresonators have triggered a large number of applications, including in terabit-coherent
  optical communications, atomic clocks, ultrafast distance measurements, dual-comb
  spectroscopy, photonic integrated frequency synthesizers, and the calibration of
  astrophysical spectrometers for exoplanet searches. OUTLOOKThe reliable generation
  of DKSs in microresonators has established a nascent research field at the interface
  of soliton physics, frequency metrology, and integrated photonics and provided impetus
  to microcomb sources. Emerging frontiers include using advances in nanofabrication
  and materials synthesis to realize ultralow-propagation-loss photonic nanostructures
  with unusual dispersion properties, which could explore dissipative solitons in
  new and unexplored parameter regimes and allow the synthesis of even broader spectra
  that in time domain could correspond to single-cycle pulses and whose spectral bandwidth
  could be extended to the mid-infrared or visible range. Beyond the narrow class
  of materials used for DKSs so far (Si, MgF2, SiO2, and Si3N4), many other materials
  exist with distinct advantages, such as III-V semiconductors, which are already
  widely used in light-emitting or laser diodes. Beyond existing applications, DKSs
  could be applied to optical coherence tomography, Raman spectral imaging, chip-scale
  atomic clocks based on optical transitions, or ultrafast photonic analog-to-digital
  conversion and have a potential to make frequency metrology and spectroscopy ubiquitous.

  SIMON HOENL, EPFL The development of compact, chip-scale optical frequency comb
  sources (microcombs) based on parametric frequency conversion in microresonators
  has seen applications in terabit optical coherent communications, atomic clocks,
  ultrafast distance measurements, dual-comb spectroscopy, and the calibration of
  astophysical spectrometers and have enabled the creation of photonic-chip integrated
  frequency synthesizers. Underlying these recent advances has been the observation
  of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in microresonators, which represent self-enforcing,
  stationary, and localized solutions of a damped, driven, and detuned nonlinear Schrödinger
  equation, which was first introduced to describe spatial self-organization phenomena.
  The generation of dissipative Kerr solitons provide a mechanism by which coherent
  optical combs with bandwidth exceeding one octave can be synthesized and have given
  rise to a host of phenomena, such as the Stokes soliton, soliton crystals, soliton
  switching, or dispersive waves. Soliton microcombs are compact, are compatible with
  wafer-scale processing, operate at low power, can operate with gigahertz to terahertz
  line spacing, and can enable the implementation of frequency combs in remote and
  mobile environments outside the laboratory environment, on Earth, airborne, or in
  outer space."
