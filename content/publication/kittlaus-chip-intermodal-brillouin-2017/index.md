abstract: Brillouin nonlinearities---which result from coupling between photons and
  acoustic phonons---are exceedingly weak in conventional nanophotonic silicon waveguides.
  Only recently have Brillouin interactions been transformed into the strongest and
  most tailorable nonlinear interactions in silicon using a new class of optomechanical
  waveguides that control both light and sound. In this paper, we use a multi-mode
  optomechanical waveguide to create stimulated Brillouin scattering between light-fields
  guided in distinct spatial modes of an integrated waveguide for the first time.
  This interaction, termed stimulated inter-modal Brillouin scattering, decouples
  Stokes and anti-Stokes processes to enable single-sideband amplification and dynamics
  that permit near-unity power conversion. Using integrated mode multiplexers to address
  separate optical modes, we show that circulators and narrowband filters are not
  necessary to separate pump and signal waves. We also demonstrate net optical amplification
  and Brillouin energy transfer as the basis for flexible on-chip light sources, amplifiers,
  nonreciprocal devices and signal-processing technologies.
