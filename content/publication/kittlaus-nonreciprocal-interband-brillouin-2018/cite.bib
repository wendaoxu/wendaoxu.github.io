 abstract = {Non-reciprocal light propagation is essential to control optical crosstalk and back-scatter in photonic systems. However, realizing high-fidelity non-reciprocity in low-loss integrated photonic circuits remains challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a form of non-local acousto-optic light scattering to produce non-reciprocal single-sideband modulation and mode conversion in an integrated silicon photonic platform. In this system, a travelling-wave acoustic phonon driven by optical forces in a silicon waveguide spatiotemporally modulates light in a separate waveguide through linear interband Brillouin scattering. This process extends narrowband optomechanics-based schemes for non-reciprocity to travelling-wave physics, enabling large operation bandwidths of more than 125\,GHz and up to 38\,dB of non-reciprocal contrast between forward- and backward-propagating optical waves. The modulator operation wavelength is tunable over a 35-nm range by varying the optical drive wavelength. Such travelling-wave acousto-optic interactions provide a promising path toward the realization of broadband, low-loss isolators and circulators within integrated photonics.},
