abstract: Non-reciprocal light propagation is essential to control optical crosstalk
  and back-scatter in photonic systems. However, realizing high-fidelity non-reciprocity
  in low-loss integrated photonic circuits remains challenging. Here, we experimentally
  demonstrate a form of non-local acousto-optic light scattering to produce non-reciprocal
  single-sideband modulation and mode conversion in an integrated silicon photonic
  platform. In this system, a travelling-wave acoustic phonon driven by optical forces
  in a silicon waveguide spatiotemporally modulates light in a separate waveguide
  through linear interband Brillouin scattering. This process extends narrowband optomechanics-based
  schemes for non-reciprocity to travelling-wave physics, enabling large operation
  bandwidths of more than 125,GHz and up to 38,dB of non-reciprocal contrast between
  forward- and backward-propagating optical waves. The modulator operation wavelength
  is tunable over a 35-nm range by varying the optical drive wavelength. Such travelling-wave
  acousto-optic interactions provide a promising path toward the realization of broadband,
  low-loss isolators and circulators within integrated photonics.
