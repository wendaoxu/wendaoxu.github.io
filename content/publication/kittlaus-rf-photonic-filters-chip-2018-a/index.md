abstract: The creation of high-performance narrow-band filters is of great interest
  for many radio frequency (RF) signal processing applications. To this end, numerous
  schemes for electronic, microelectromechanical systems-based, and microwave photonic
  filters have been demonstrated. Filtering schemes based on microwave photonic systems
  offer superior flexibility and tunability to traditional RF filters. However, these
  optical-based filters are typically limited to gigahertz (GHz) widths and often
  have large RF insertion losses, posing challenges for integration into high-fidelity
  RF circuits. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel type of microwave filter that
  combines the attractive features of microwave photonic filters with high-Q phononic
  signal processing using a photonic-phononic emit-receive process. Through this process,
  an RF signal, which is encoded on a guided optical wave, is converted into a GHz-frequency
  acoustic wave, where it is filtered through shaping of acoustic transfer functions
  before being converted back to the optical domain. In contrast to prior phononic
  filters that utilize gain or loss based on stimulated Brillouin scattering, optical
  amplification is not used to mediate signal processing. This emit-receive functionality,
  realized in an integrated silicon waveguide, produces megahertz-bandwidth bandpass
  filtering while supporting low RF insertion losses necessary for high dynamic range
  in a microwave photonic link. We also demonstrate record-high internal efficiency
  for emit-receive operations of this type, and show that the emit-receive operation
  is uniquely suitable for the creation of serial filter banks with minimal loss of
  fidelity. This photonic-phononic emitter-receiver represents a new method for low-distortion
  signal processing in an integrated all-silicon device.
