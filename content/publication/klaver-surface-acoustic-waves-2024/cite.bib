 abstract = {Seamlessly integrating stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a low-loss and mature photonic integration platform remains a complicated task. Virtually all current approaches fall short in simultaneously achieving strong SBS, low losses, and technological scalability. In this work we incorporate stong SBS into a standard silicon nitride platform by a simple deposition of a tellurium oxide layer, a commonly used material for acousto-optic modulators. In these heterogeneously integrated waveguides, we harness novel SBS interactions actuated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) leading to more than two orders of magnitude gain enhancement. Three novel applications are demonstrated in this platform: (i) a silicon nitride Brillouin amplifier with 5 dB net optical gain, (ii) a compact intermodal stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL) capable of high purity radio frequency (RF) signal generation with 7 Hz intrinsic linewidth, and (iii) a widely tunable microwave photonic notch filter with ultra-narrow linewidth of 2.2 MHz enabled by Brillouin induced opacity. These advancements can unlock an array of new RF and optical technologies to be directly integrated in silicon nitride.},
