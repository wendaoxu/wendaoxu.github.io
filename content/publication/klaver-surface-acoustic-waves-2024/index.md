abstract: 'Seamlessly integrating stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a low-loss
  and mature photonic integration platform remains a complicated task. Virtually all
  current approaches fall short in simultaneously achieving strong SBS, low losses,
  and technological scalability. In this work we incorporate stong SBS into a standard
  silicon nitride platform by a simple deposition of a tellurium oxide layer, a commonly
  used material for acousto-optic modulators. In these heterogeneously integrated
  waveguides, we harness novel SBS interactions actuated by surface acoustic waves
  (SAWs) leading to more than two orders of magnitude gain enhancement. Three novel
  applications are demonstrated in this platform: (i) a silicon nitride Brillouin
  amplifier with 5 dB net optical gain, (ii) a compact intermodal stimulated Brillouin
  laser (SBL) capable of high purity radio frequency (RF) signal generation with 7
  Hz intrinsic linewidth, and (iii) a widely tunable microwave photonic notch filter
  with ultra-narrow linewidth of 2.2 MHz enabled by Brillouin induced opacity. These
  advancements can unlock an array of new RF and optical technologies to be directly
  integrated in silicon nitride.'
