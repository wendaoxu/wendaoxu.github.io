 abstract = {We review recent progress in applying stimulated Brillouin scattering to microwave photonic links in multiple signal processing contexts. Dynamic bandpass filters, high selectivity notch filters, and wideband phase shifters are demonstrated. These developments promise to advance the state of the art in wideband microwave systems.},
