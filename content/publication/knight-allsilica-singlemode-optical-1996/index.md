abstract: 'We report the fabrication of a new type of optical waveguide: the photonic
  crystal fiber. It consists of a pure silica core surrounded by a silica--air photonic
  crystal material with a hexagonal symmetry. The fiber supports a single robust low-loss
  guided mode over a very broad spectral range of at least 458--1550 nm.'
