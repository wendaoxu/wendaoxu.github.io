abstract: A fundamentally different type of optical waveguide structure is demonstrated,
  in which light is confined to the vicinity of a low-index region by a two-dimensional
  photonic band gap crystal. The waveguide consists of an extra air hole in an otherwise
  regular honeycomb pattern of holes running down the length of a fine silica glass
  fiber. Optical fibers based on this waveguide mechanism support guided modes with
  extraordinary properties.
