 abstract = {Photonic crystal fibres have wavelength-scale morphological microstructure running down their length. This structure enables light to be controlled within the fibre in ways not previously possible or even imaginable. Our understanding of what an optical fibre is and what it does is changing because of the development of this new technology, and a broad range of applications based on these principles is being developed.},
