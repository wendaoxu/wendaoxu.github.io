abstract: Photonic crystal fibres have wavelength-scale morphological microstructure
  running down their length. This structure enables light to be controlled within
  the fibre in ways not previously possible or even imaginable. Our understanding
  of what an optical fibre is and what it does is changing because of the development
  of this new technology, and a broad range of applications based on these principles
  is being developed.
