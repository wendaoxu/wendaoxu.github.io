 abstract = {Broadband measurements of the frequency-dependent group delay in a Ti:sapphire passive mode-locked laser operating at a 100-fs pulse width under various conditions are reported. From these measurements one can determine the dispersive limits and the connection between dispersion and mode-locking stability in the self-mode-locked regime.},
