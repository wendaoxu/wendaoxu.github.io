abstract: Broadband measurements of the frequency-dependent group delay in a Ti:sapphire
  passive mode-locked laser operating at a 100-fs pulse width under various conditions
  are reported. From these measurements one can determine the dispersive limits and
  the connection between dispersion and mode-locking stability in the self-mode-locked
  regime.
