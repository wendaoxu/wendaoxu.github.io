abstract: We present a detailed overview of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS)
  in                single-mode optical fibers. The review is divided into two parts.
  In the first part,                we discuss the fundamentals of SBS. A particular
  emphasis is given to analytical                calculation of the backreflected
  power and SBS threshold (SBST) in optical fibers                with various index
  profiles. For this, we consider acousto-optic interaction in the                guiding
  geometry and derive the modal overlap integral, which describes the                dependence
  of the Brillouin gain on the refractive index profile of the optical                fiber.
  We analyze Stokes backreflected power initiated by thermal phonons, compare                values
  of the SBST calculated from different approximations, and discuss the SBST                dependence
  on the fiber length. We also review an analytical approach to calculate                the
  gain of Brillouin fiber amplifiers (BFAs) in the regime of pump depletion. In the                high-gain
  regime, fiber loss is a nonnegligible effect and needs to be accounted for                along
  with the pump depletion. We provide an accurate analytic expression for the BFA                gain
  and show results of experimental validation. Finally, we review methods to                suppress
  SBS including index-controlled acoustic guiding or segmented fiber links.                The
  second part of the review deals with recent advances in fiber-optic applications                where
  SBS is a relevant effect. In particular, we discuss the impact of SBS on the                radio-over-fiber
  technology, enhancement of the SBS efficiency in Raman-pumped                fibers,
  slow light due to SBS and SBS-based optical delay lines, Brillouin                fiber-optic
  sensors, and SBS mitigation in high-power fiber lasers, as well as SBS in                multimode
  and microstructured fibers. A detailed derivation of evolutional equations                in
  the guided wave geometry as well as key physical relations are given in                appendices.
