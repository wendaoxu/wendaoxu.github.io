 abstract = {The freely-suspended glass membranes in a dual-nanoweb fiber, driven at resonance by intensity-modulated light, exhibit a giant optomechanical nonlinearity. We experimentally investigate the effect of squeezed-film damping by exploring the pressure dependence of resonant frequency and mechanical quality factor. As a consequence of the unusually narrow slot between the nanowebs (22\,$μ$m by 550\,nm), the gas-spring effect causes a pressure-dependent frequency shift that is $∼$15 times greater than typically measured in micro-electro-mechanical devices. When evacuated, the dual-nanoweb fiber yields a quality factor of $∼$3\,600 and a resonant optomechanical nonlinear coefficient that is $∼$60\,000 times larger than the Kerr effect.},
