abstract: The freely-suspended glass membranes in a dual-nanoweb fiber, driven at
  resonance by intensity-modulated light, exhibit a giant optomechanical nonlinearity.
  We experimentally investigate the effect of squeezed-film damping by exploring the
  pressure dependence of resonant frequency and mechanical quality factor. As a consequence
  of the unusually narrow slot between the nanowebs (22,$μ$m by 550,nm), the gas-spring
  effect causes a pressure-dependent frequency shift that is $∼$15 times greater than
  typically measured in micro-electro-mechanical devices. When evacuated, the dual-nanoweb
  fiber yields a quality factor of $∼$3,600 and a resonant optomechanical nonlinear
  coefficient that is $∼$60,000 times larger than the Kerr effect.
