abstract: Hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers are shown to substantially enhance four-wave
  mixing (FWM) of laser pulses in a gas filling the fiber core. Picosecond pulses
  of Nd&#x003A;YAG fundamental radiation and its second harmonic are used to generate
  a signal at the frequency of the third harmonic by the FWM process 3&#x2375;=2&#x2375;&#x002B;2&#x2375;-&#x2375;
  . The efficiency achieved for this process in a 9-cm-long, 13&#x002D;mu;m -hollow-core-diameter
  photonic-crystal fiber, designed to simultaneously transmit a two-color pump and
  the FWM signal, is shown to be ~800 times higher than the maximum FWM efficiency
  attainable with the same laser pulses in the tight-focusing regime.
