abstract: We report experimental results which show that the stimulated Brillouin
  scattering (SBS) spectrum in an optical fiber is inhomogeneous, exhibiting spectral
  broadening and hole burning under cw monochromatic laser excitation. This phenomenon
  arises from the waveguide interaction of the pump and Stokes signals and is a fundamental
  property of SBS in waveguiding systems due to their ability to confine a fan of
  radiation wave vector directions. oÌ§pyright 2000 The American Physical Society.
