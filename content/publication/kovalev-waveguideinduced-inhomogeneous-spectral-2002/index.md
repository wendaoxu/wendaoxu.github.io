abstract: We provide direct experimental evidence of waveguide-induced inhomogeneous
  spectral broadening of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in optical fiber. It
  is shown that the SBS spectral width and gain depend on the numerical aperture for
  both single-mode and multimode fibers, the functional dependencies of which are
  in good agreement with our model description of the phenomenon.
