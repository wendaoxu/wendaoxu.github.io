abstract: For many fiber applications, the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) contains
  important information including the Brillouin frequency shift, the Brillouin spontaneous
  linewidth, and the Brillouin gain coefficient. This paper is the first, to the best
  of our knowledge, to present an accurate numerical simulation of the BGS in single-mode
  fibers. The simulated and measured BGS were in good agreement. Through repeated
  numerical simulations, we revealed a tendency of the peak Brillouin gain coefficient
  that determines the stimulated Brillouin scattering threshold.
