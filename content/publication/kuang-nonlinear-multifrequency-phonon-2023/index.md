abstract: Phonon lasers, which exploit coherent amplifications of phonons, are a means
  to explore nonlinear phononics, image nanomaterial structures and operate phononic
  devices. Recently, a phonon laser governed by dispersive optomechanical coupling
  has been demonstrated by levitating a nanosphere in an optical tweezer. Such levitated
  optomechanical devices, with minimal noise in high vacuum, can allow flexible control
  of large-mass objects without any internal discrete energy levels. However, it is
  challenging to achieve phonon lasing with levitated microscale objects because optical
  scattering losses are much larger than at the nanoscale. Here we report a nonlinear
  multi-frequency phonon laser with a micro-size sphere, which is governed by dissipative
  coupling. The active gain provided by a Yb3+-doped system plays a key role. It achieves
  three orders of magnitude for the amplitude of the fundamental-mode phonon lasing,
  compared with the passive device. In addition, nonlinear mechanical harmonics can
  emerge spontaneously above the lasing threshold. Furthermore, we observe coherent
  correlations of phonons for both the fundamental mode and its harmonics. Our work
  drives the field of levitated optomechanics into a regime where it becomes feasible
  to engineer collective motional properties of typical micro-size objects.
