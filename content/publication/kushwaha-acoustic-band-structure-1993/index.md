abstract: We present the first full band-structure calculations for periodic, elastic
  composites. For transverse polarization of the vibrations we obtain a ``phononic''
  band gap which extends throughout the Brillouin zone. A complete acoustic gap or
  a low density of states should have important consequences for the suppression of
  zero-point motion and for the localization of phonons, and may lead to improvements
  in transducers and in the creation of a vibrationless environment.
