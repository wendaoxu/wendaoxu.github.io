abstract: We study an elastic composite described by the position-dependent mass density
  $h̊o$(r), the longitudinal speed of sound cl(r), and the transverse speed of sound
  ct(r). For a spatially periodic composite---a ``phononic crystal''---we derive the
  eigenvalue equation for the frequencies $ømega$n(K), where n is the serial number
  of the band and K is the Bloch wave vector. This is applied to the special case
  of a binary composite and, further, to the case of infinite cylinders that form
  a two-dimensional lattice. For this configuration (and no wave-vector component
  parallel to the cylinders) there are two independent modes of vibration. The elastic
  displacement u(r) is parallel to the cylinders for one of them---the transverse
  polarization mode. The other one is a mixed (longitudinal-transverse) polarization
  mode with u(r) perpendicular to the cylinders. Specifically we consider circular
  cylinders that form a square lattice. We compute the band structures for the transverse
  modes of nickel alloy cylinders in an aluminum alloy host, and vice versa. In both
  situations we find band gaps which extend throughout the Brillouin zone. Within
  these gaps the transverse vibrations, sound, and phonons are forbidden. We also
  investigate the dependence of the band gap on the filling fraction and on the material
  parameters.
