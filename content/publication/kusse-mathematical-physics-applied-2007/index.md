abstract: What sets this volume apart from other mathematics texts is its emphasis
  on mathematical tools commonly used by scientists and engineers to solve real-world
  problems. Using a unique approach, it covers intermediate and advanced material
  in a manner appropriate for undergraduate students. Based on author Bruce Kusse's
  course at the Department of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University,
  Mathematical Physics begins with essentials such as vector and tensor algebra, curvilinear
  coordinate systems, complex variables, Fourier series, Fourier and Laplace transforms,
  differential and integral equations, and solutions to Laplace's equations. The book
  moves on to explain complex topics that often fall through the cracks in undergraduate
  programs, including the Dirac delta-function, multivalued complex functions using
  branch cuts, branch points and Riemann sheets, contravariant and covariant tensors,
  and an introduction to group theory. This expanded second edition contains a new
  appendix on the calculus of variation -- a valuable addition to the already superb
  collection of topics on offer. This is an ideal text for upper-level undergraduates
  in physics, applied physics, physical chemistry, biophysics, and all areas of engineering.
  It allows physics professors to prepare students for a wide range of employment
  in science and engineering and makes an excellent reference for scientists and engineers
  in industry. Worked out examples appear throughout the book and exercises follow
  every chapter. Solutions to the odd-numbered exercises are available for lecturers
  at www.wiley-vch.de/textbooks/. oÌ§pyright 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
