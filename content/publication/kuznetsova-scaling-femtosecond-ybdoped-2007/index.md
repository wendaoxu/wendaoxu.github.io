abstract: We demonstrate that the compensation of self-phase modulation by third-order
  dispersion can be exploited in the design of fiber amplifiers with tens of microjoules
  pulse energy. At the highest energies, the amplified pulse accumulates nonlinear
  phase shift as large as 17 $π$. Gain-narrowing occurs in the final amplifier stage,
  but shorter pulses are still generated with larger nonlinear phase shifts. A large-mode-area
  Yb-doped photonic crystal fiber amplifier generates diffraction-limited 30 $μ$J
  pulses, which are compressed to 240fs duration. These are converted to the second
  harmonic with 48% conversion efficiency, as expected theoretically, which confirms
  the pulse quality.
