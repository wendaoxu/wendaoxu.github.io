abstract: A complete analysis of symmetric 2 × 2 fused-fiber couplers in terms of
  supermode beating is made. The tranverse and longitudinal geometry of the couplers
  has been carefully modeled to take into account the fabrication parameters. The
  first two scalar supermodes and their polarization corrections have then been calculated
  for each degree of fusion and taper ratio, resulting in powerful tools for the design
  of particular couplers. The good agreement between the observed and the predicted
  responses for slightly and strongly fused couplers confirms the validity of each
  step of this analysis.
