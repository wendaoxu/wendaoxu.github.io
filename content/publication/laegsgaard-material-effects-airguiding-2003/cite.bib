 abstract = {The waveguiding properties of two silica-based, air-guiding photonic bandgap fiber designs are investigated with special emphasis on material effects. The nonlinear coefficients are found to be 1--2 orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained in index-guiding microstructured fibers with large mode areas. The material dispersion of silica makes a significant contribution to the total chromatic dispersion even though less than 10% of the field energy is located in the silica regions of the fibers. These findings suggest that dispersion engineering through the choice of base material may be a possibility in this type of fiber.},
