abstract: The waveguiding properties of two silica-based, air-guiding photonic bandgap
  fiber designs are investigated with special emphasis on material effects. The nonlinear
  coefficients are found to be 1--2 orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained
  in index-guiding microstructured fibers with large mode areas. The material dispersion
  of silica makes a significant contribution to the total chromatic dispersion even
  though less than 10% of the field energy is located in the silica regions of the
  fibers. These findings suggest that dispersion engineering through the choice of
  base material may be a possibility in this type of fiber.
