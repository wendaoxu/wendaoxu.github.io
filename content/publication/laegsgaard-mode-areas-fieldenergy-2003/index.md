abstract: The field-energy distributions and effective mode areas of silica-based
  photonic bandgap fibers with a honeycomb air-hole structure in the cladding and
  an extra air hole defining the core are investigated. We present a generalization
  of the common effective-area definition, suitable for the problem at hand, and compare
  the results for the photonic bandgap fibers with those of index-guiding microstructured
  fibers. While the majority of the field energy in the honeycomb photonic bandgap
  fibers is found to reside in the silica, a substantial fraction (up to $∼$30%) can
  be located in the air holes. This property may show such fibers as particularly
  interesting for sensor applications, especially those based on nonlinear effects
  or interaction with other structures (e.g., Bragg gratings) in the glass.
