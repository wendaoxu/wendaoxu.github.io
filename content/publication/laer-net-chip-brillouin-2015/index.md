abstract: The century-old study of photon--phonon coupling has seen a remarkable revival
  in the past decade. Driven by early observations of dynamical back-action, the field
  progressed to ground-state cooling and the counting of individual phonons. A recent
  branch investigates the potential of traveling-wave, optically broadband photon--phonon
  interaction in silicon circuits. Here, we report continuous-wave Brillouin gain
  exceeding the optical losses in a series of suspended silicon beams, a step towards
  selective on-chip amplifiers. We obtain efficiencies up to the highest to date in
  the phononic gigahertz range. We also find indications that geometric disorder poses
  a significant challenge towards nanoscale phonon-based technologies.
