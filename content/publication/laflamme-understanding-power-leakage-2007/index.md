abstract: The cause of fundamental core-mode leakage in a tapered photonic crystal
  fiber is examined in terms of modal coupling from the core-mode to the ring modes.
  Experimental data are compared to predictions. The main features of the transmission
  are convincingly explained by the proposed model.
