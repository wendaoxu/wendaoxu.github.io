abstract: Fiber tapers provide a way to rapidly measure the spectra of many types
  of optical microcavities. Proper fabrication of the taper ensures that its width
  varies sufficiently slowly (adiabatically) along the length of the taper so as to
  maintain single spatial mode propagation. This is usually accomplished by monitoring
  the spectral transmission through the taper. In addition to this characterization
  method it is also helpful to know the taper width versus length. By developing a
  model of optical backscattering within the fiber taper, it is possible to use backscatter
  measurements to characterize the taper width versus length. The model uses the concept
  of a local taper numerical aperture to accurately account for varying backscatter
  collection along the length of the taper. In addition to taper profile information,
  the backscatter reflectometry method delineates locations along the taper where
  fluctuations in fiber core refractive index, cladding refractive index, and taper
  surface roughness each provide the dominant source of backscattering. Rayleigh backscattering
  coefficients are also extracted by fitting the data with the model and are consistent
  with the fiber manufacturer&#x02019;s datasheet. The optical backscattering reflectometer
  is also used to observe defects resulting from microcracks and surface contamination.
  All of this information can be obtained before the taper is removed from its fabrication
  apparatus. The backscattering method should also be prove useful for characterization
  of nanofibers.
