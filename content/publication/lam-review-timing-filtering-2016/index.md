abstract: The explosive growth of the smartphone market especially in supporting LTE
  (Long Term Evolution) to meet continuous demand for more and faster data transfer
  has drawn interest from many who want to know how timing and filtering components
  are used in smartphones to support the crowded spectrum and their future market
  opportunities. Known to many, the timing and filtering functions in smartphones
  have been diligently supported for many years by some ``physically moving'' electromechanical
  components based on piezoelectric materials-quartz-based crystal, lithium tantalate-
  and lithium niobate-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) RF filter, and aluminum nitride-based
  bulk acoustic wave (BAW) RF filter. This paper reviews the current timing and filtering
  technologies in smartphones and discusses the possible trends.
