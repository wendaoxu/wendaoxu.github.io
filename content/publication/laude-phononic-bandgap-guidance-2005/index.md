abstract: The elastic modes guided along the axis of an optical fiber are obtained
  for an arbitrary finite cross section using waveguide finite element analysis. The
  band structure of acoustic phonons is obtained from this full-vector computation.
  The analysis is applied to the case of a photonic crystal fiber possessing a honeycomb
  lattice. It is shown that this fiber exhibits band gaps for elastic modes propagating
  along the longitudinal fiber axis. For frequencies within a band gap, the external
  boundary of the fiber becomes a defect of the phononic crystal that supports the
  propagation of guided elastic modes. Such boundary modes are very sensitive to the
  boundary conditions. The further introduction of a defect within the two-dimensional
  phononic crystal leads to the formation of highly confined elastic waveguide modes
  that copropagate in the same core volume as the guided optical mode. We consider
  the application of these properties to the suppression of stimulated Brillouin scattering
  and to enhanced collinear acousto-optical interactions. In particular, we obtain
  the optimum elastic modal shape that maximizes the acousto-optical scattering coefficient
  for given optical modes.
