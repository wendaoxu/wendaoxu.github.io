abstract: Ultrahigh-Q optical resonators are being studied across a wide range of
  fields, including quantum information, nonlinear optics, cavity optomechanics and
  telecommunications1-7. Here, we demonstrate a new resonator with a record Q-factor
  of 875 million for on-chip devices. The fabrication of our device avoids the requirement
  for a specialized processing step, which in microtoroid resonators8 has made it
  difficult to control their size and achieve millimetre- and centimetre-scale diameters.
  Attaining these sizes is important in applications such as microcombs and potentially
  also in rotation sensing. As an application of size control, stimulated Brillouin
  lasers incorporating our device are demonstrated. The resonators not only set a
  new benchmark for the Q-factor on a chip, but also provide, for the first time,
  full compatibility of this important device class with conventional semiconductor
  processing. This feature will greatly expand the range of possible 'system on a
  chip' functions enabled by ultrahigh-Q devices. oÌ§pyright 2012 Macmillan Publishers
