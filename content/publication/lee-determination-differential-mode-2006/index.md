abstract: We present a novel differential mode delay (DMD) measurement method for
  a multimode optical fiber (MMF) based on Fourier-domain low-coherence interferometry
  (fLCI) for the first time. An optical spectrum analyzer and a mode scrambler are
  used to obtain the intermodal interference signal in spectral domain after light
  passes an MMF. The MMF is used as a common path interferometer by itself without
  using any reference arm in an interferometer. Instead of using an offset launching
  technique, we present an effective method to obtain all available intermodal interference
  signals at a single shot by using a mode scrambler. The measured results using the
  proposed method are compared with those obtained using a conventional time-domain
  DMD measurement method.
