abstract: We propose a novel mode analysis and differential mode delay measurement
  method for an optical fiber using Fourier-domain low-coherence interferometry. A
  spectral interferometer based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer setup was used with
  a broadband source and an optical spectrum analyzer to detect relative temporal
  delays between the guided modes of a few-mode optical fiber by analyzing spectral
  interference signals. We have shown that experimental results of the proposed method
  agree well with those results obtained by using a conventional time-domain measurement
  method. We have demonstrated that this new mode analysis technique has high sensitivity
  (&lt;60 dB) and very good resolution (&lt;1 ps/m).
