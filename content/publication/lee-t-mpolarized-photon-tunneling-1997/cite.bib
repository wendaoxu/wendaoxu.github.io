 abstract = {We calculate posttunneling positions and tunneling time (phase time) for TM photon tunneling in a frustrated-total-internal-reflection (FTIR) structure. We do this by converting the TM photon tunneling problem in the FTIR structure into the electron tunneling problem for a heterostructure potential barrier with a position-dependent effective mass. The results derived are compared with those of FTIR tunneling cases with TE photons.},
