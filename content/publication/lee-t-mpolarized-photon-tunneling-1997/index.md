abstract: We calculate posttunneling positions and tunneling time (phase time) for
  TM photon tunneling in a frustrated-total-internal-reflection (FTIR) structure.
  We do this by converting the TM photon tunneling problem in the FTIR structure into
  the electron tunneling problem for a heterostructure potential barrier with a position-dependent
  effective mass. The results derived are compared with those of FTIR tunneling cases
  with TE photons.
