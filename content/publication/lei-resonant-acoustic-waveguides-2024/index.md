abstract: Empowering independent control of optical and acoustic modes and enhancing
  the photon-phonon interaction, integrated photonics boosts the advancements of on-chip
  stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). However, achieving acoustic waveguides with
  low loss, tailorability, and easy fabrication remains a challenge. Here, inspired
  by the optical anti-resonance in hollow-core fibers, we propose suspended anti-resonant
  acoustic waveguides (SARAWs) with superior confinement and high selectivity of acoustic
  modes, supporting both forward and backward SBS on chip. Furthermore, this structure
  streamlines the design and fabrication processes. Leveraging the advantages of SARAWs,
  we have showcased a series of record-breaking results for SBS within a compact footprint
  on the silicon-on-insulator platform. For forward SBS, a centimeter-scale SARAW
  supports a large net gain exceeding 6.4 dB. For backward SBS, we have observed an
  unprecedented Brillouin frequency shift of 27.6 GHz and a mechanical quality factor
  of up to 1,960 in silicon waveguides. This paradigm of acoustic waveguide propels
  SBS into a new era, unlocking new opportunities in the fields of optomechanics,
  phononic circuits, and hybrid quantum systems.
