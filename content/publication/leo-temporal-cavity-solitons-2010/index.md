abstract: Temporal cavity solitons are packets of light persisting in a continuously
  driven nonlinear resonator. They are robust attracting states, readily excited through
  a phase-insensitive and wavelength-insensitive process. As such, they constitute
  an ideal support for bits in an optical buffer that would seamlessly combine three
  critical telecommunication functions, namely all-optical storage, all-optical reshaping
  and wavelength conversion. Here, with standard silica optical fibres, we report
  the first experimental observation of temporal cavity solitons. The cavity solitons
  are 4 ps long and are used to demonstrate storage of a data stream for more than
  a second. We also observe interactions of close cavity solitons, revealing for our
  set-up a potential capacity of up to 45,000 bits at 25 Gbit s-1. More fundamentally,
  cavity solitons are localized dissipative structures. Therefore, given that silica
  exhibits a pure instantaneous Kerr nonlinearity, our experiment constitutes one
  of the simplest examples of self-organization phenomena in nonlinear optics.
