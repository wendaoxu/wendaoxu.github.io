abstract: We demonstrate a 3x1 fiber-based photonic lantern spatial-multiplexer with
  mode-selectivity greater than 6 dB and transmission loss of less than 0.3 dB. The
  total insertion loss of the mode-selective multiplexers when coupled to a graded-index
  few-mode fiber was &lt; 2 dB. These mode multiplexers showed mode-dependent loss
  below 0.5 dB. To our knowledge these are the lowest insertion and mode-dependent
  loss devices, which are also fully compatible with conventional few-mode fiber technology
  and broadband operation.
