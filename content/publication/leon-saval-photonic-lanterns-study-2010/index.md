abstract: The ``photonic lantern,'' an optical fibre device that has emerged from
  the field of astrophotonics, allows for a single-mode photonic function to take
  place within a multimode fibre. We study and evaluate the modal behaviour of photonic
  lanterns as well as the conditions for achieving low-loss between a multimode fibre
  and a ``near-diffraction limited'' single-mode system. We also present an intuitive
  analogy of the modal electromagnetic propagation behaviour along the photonic lantern
  transition in terms of the Kronig-Penney model in Quantum Mechanics.
