abstract: An account of the development of microwave filters is surveyed, commencing
  from 1937. Much of the foundation of modem filter theory and practice took place
  during the period of World War II and the years immediately following, especially
  by such pioneers as the late P. I. Richards, whose subsequent career is briefly
  described. Filter topics discussed include low-pass, bandpass, high-pass, and multiplexers
  constructed in a variety of media such as waveguide, coaxial line, microstrip, and
  stripline, as well as dielectric resonators. All types of filter characteristics
  are surveyed, such as Chebyshev, elliptic and pseudo-elliptic function, Achieser-Zolotarev,
  and a variety of generalized designs, including linear phase.
