abstract: Recently, a high efficiency, narrow-linewidth, chip-based stimulated Brillouin
  laser (SBL) was demonstrated using an ultra-high-Q, silica-on-silicon resonator.
  In this work, this novel laser is more fully characterized. The Schawlow Townes
  linewidth formula for Brillouin laser operation is derived and compared to linewidth
  data, and the fitting is used to measure the mechanical thermal quanta contribution
  to the Brillouin laser linewidth. A study of laser mode pulling by the Brillouin
  optical gain spectrum is also presented, and high-order, cascaded operation of the
  SBL is demonstrated. Potential application of these devices to microwave sources
  and phase-coherent communication is discussed.
