 abstract = {A new definition for tunneling time of photons in a frustrated-total-internal-reflection structure is introduced under the assumption that the tunneling speed of photons is the energy-transfer speed of light in the tunneling region. This definition eliminates the problem of superluminality, and the suggested tunneling speed defines an orbit equation that gives a lateral shift of tunneling photons.},
