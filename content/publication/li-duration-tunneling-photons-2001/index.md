abstract: A new definition for tunneling time of photons in a frustrated-total-internal-reflection
  structure is introduced under the assumption that the tunneling speed of photons
  is the energy-transfer speed of light in the tunneling region. This definition eliminates
  the problem of superluminality, and the suggested tunneling speed defines an orbit
  equation that gives a lateral shift of tunneling photons.
