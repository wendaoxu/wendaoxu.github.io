abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), originating from the coupling between
  optical and acoustic waves, has been widely applied in many fields. Silicon is the
  most used and important material in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and integrated
  photonic circuits. However, strong acoustic-optic interaction in silicon requires
  mechanical release of the silicon core waveguide to avoid acoustic energy leakage
  into the substrate. This will not only reduce the mechanical stability and thermal
  conduction, but also increase the difficulties for fabrication and large-area device
  integration. In this paper, we propose a silicon-aluminium nitride(AlN)-sapphire
  platform for realizing large SBS gain without suspending the waveguide. AlN is used
  as a buffer layer to reduce the phonon leakage. This platform can be fabricated
  via the wafer bonding between silicon and commercial AlN-sapphire wafer. We adopt
  a full-vectorial model to simulate the SBS gain. Both the material loss and the
  anchor loss of the silicon are considered. We also apply the genetic algorithm to
  optimize the waveguide structure. By limiting the maximum etching step number to
  two, we obtain a simple structure to achieve the SBS gain of 2462 W&#x2212;1m&#x2212;1
  for forward SBS, which is 8 times larger than the recently reported result in unsuspended
  silicon waveguide. Our platform can enable Brillouin-related phenomena in centimetre-scale
  waveguides. Our findings could pave the way toward large-area unreleased opto-mechanics
  on silicon.
