abstract: $<$p id=\"p1\"$>$There have been many types of filters for various communication
  implications such as surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters, bulk wave (BAW) filters,
  transmission line filters, cavity filters, substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)
  filters, etc. As the radio frequency (RF) front end continues to develop, bandpass
  filters (BPFs) with excellent frequency response and tunability are becoming more
  and more competitive. In this chapter, three different types are reported, including
  On-chip-based TBPF, microstrip-based TBPF, and SIW-based TBPF, and some of them
  are theoretically analyzed carefully. Filters with frequency tuning, bandwidth tuning,
  and transmission zeros tuning are shown comprehensively. In addition, the limitations
  and future trends of tunable microwave filters are objectively expounded.$<$/p$>$
