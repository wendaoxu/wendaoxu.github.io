 abstract = {A novel microwave shaper is proposed and demonstrated, of which the microwave spectral transfer function could be fully programmable with high resolution. We achieve this by bandwidth-compressed mapping a programmable optical wave-shaper, which has a lower frequency resolution of tens of gigahertz, to a microwave one with resolution of tens of megahertz. This is based on a novel technology of ``bandwidth scaling,'' which employs bandwidth-stretched electronic-to-optical conversion and bandwidth-compressed optical-to-electronic conversion. We demonstrate the high resolution and full reconfigurability experimentally. Furthermore, we show the group delay variation could be greatly enlarged after mapping; this is then verified by the experiment with an enlargement of 194 times. The resolution improvement and group delay magnification significantly distinguish our proposal from previous optics-to-microwave spectrum mapping.},
