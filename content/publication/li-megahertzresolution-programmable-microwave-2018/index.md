abstract: A novel microwave shaper is proposed and demonstrated, of which the microwave
  spectral transfer function could be fully programmable with high resolution. We
  achieve this by bandwidth-compressed mapping a programmable optical wave-shaper,
  which has a lower frequency resolution of tens of gigahertz, to a microwave one
  with resolution of tens of megahertz. This is based on a novel technology of ``bandwidth
  scaling,'' which employs bandwidth-stretched electronic-to-optical conversion and
  bandwidth-compressed optical-to-electronic conversion. We demonstrate the high resolution
  and full reconfigurability experimentally. Furthermore, we show the group delay
  variation could be greatly enlarged after mapping; this is then verified by the
  experiment with an enlargement of 194 times. The resolution improvement and group
  delay magnification significantly distinguish our proposal from previous optics-to-microwave
  spectrum mapping.
