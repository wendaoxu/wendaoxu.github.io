abstract: Low-phase-noise microwave oscillators are important to a wide range of subjects,
  including communications, radar and metrology. Photonic-based microwave-wave sources
  now provide record, close-to-carrier phase-noise performance, and compact sources
  using microcavities are available commercially. Photonics-based solutions address
  a challenging scaling problem in electronics, increasing attenuation with frequency.
  A second scaling challenge, however, is to maintain low phase noise in reduced form
  factor and even integrated systems. On this second front, there has been remarkable
  progress in the area of microcavity devices with large storage time (high optical
  quality factor). Here we report generation of highly coherent microwaves using a
  chip-based device that derives stability from high optical quality factor. The device
  has a record low electronic white-phase-noise floor for a microcavity-based oscillator
  and is used as the optical, voltage-controlled oscillator in the first demonstration
  of a photonic-based, microwave frequency synthesizer. The synthesizer performance
  is comparable to mid-range commercial devices.
