abstract: A novel approach to implementing a narrow-passband and frequency-tunable
  microwave photonic filter (MPF) based on phase-modulation to intensity-modulation
  conversion in a phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating (PS-FBG) is proposed and experimentally
  demonstrated. In the proposed MPF, a phase-modulated signal is sent to a PS-FBG.
  If one of the sidebands falls in the notch of the PS-FBG, the phase-modulated signal
  is converted to an intensity-modulated signal. Due to the ultra-narrow notch of
  the PS-FBG, a microwave filter with an ultra-narrow passband is realized. The tunability
  of the microwave filter is achieved by tuning the wavelength of the optical carrier.
  A theoretical analysis is performed in which the value of the phase shift and the
  location of the phase shift in the PS-FBG on the frequency response of the MPF are
  studied. Two PS-FBGs with different reflection bandwidths and different phase-shift
  values introduced at the center of the gratings are fabricated and incorporated
  into the proposed MPF. For the two PS-FBGs, the 3-dB bandwidths are 120 and 60 MHz
  and the tunable ranges are 5.5 and 15 GHz.
