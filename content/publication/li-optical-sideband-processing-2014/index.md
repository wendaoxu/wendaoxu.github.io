abstract: We propose an optical sideband processing approach for phase-modulation
  direct-detection microwave photonics link in this paper. With optical sideband processing,
  phase modulation signal is converted to intensity modulation signal for direct detection
  and nonlinearity compensation is realized to suppress third-order intermodulation
  distortion simultaneously. Theoretical analysis shows that, by imposing proper phase
  shifts on zero and second-order optical sidebands, corresponding third-order intermodulation
  distortion components can cancel each other. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried
  out for verification. Experimental results demonstrate a 30.06 dB suppression of
  third-order intermodulation distortion and the linearized link's dynamic range can
  also be improved by 17.42 dB compared with the nonlinearized link, which verify
  well a highly linearized phase-modulation direct-detection microwave photonics link
  using this proposal.
