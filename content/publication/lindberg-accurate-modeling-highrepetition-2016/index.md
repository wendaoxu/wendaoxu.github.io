abstract: A numerical model for amplification of ultrashort pulses with high repetition
  rates in fiber amplifiers is presented. The pulse propagation is modeled by jointly
  solving the steady-state rate equations and the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger
  equation, which allows accurate treatment of nonlinear and dispersive effects whilst
  considering arbitrary spatial and spectral gain dependencies. Comparison of data
  acquired by using the developed model and experimental results prove to be in good
  agreement.
