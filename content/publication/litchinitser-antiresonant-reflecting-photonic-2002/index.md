abstract: We propose a simple analytical theory for low-index core photonic bandgap
  optical waveguides based on an antiresonant reflecting guidance mechanism. We identify
  a new regime of guidance in which the spectral properties of these structures are
  largely determined by the thickness of the high-index layers and the refractive-index
  contrast and are not particularly sensitive to the period of the cladding layers.
  The attenuation properties are controlled by the number of high/low-index cladding
  layers. Numerical simulations with the beam propagation method confirm the predictions
  of the analytical model. We discuss the implications of the results for photonic
  bandgap fibers.
