abstract: Microstructured optical fibers with the low refractive index core surrounded
  by high refractive index cylindrical inclusions reveal several intriguing properties.
  Firstly, there is a guiding regime in which the fibers' confinement loss is strongly
  dependent of wavelength. In this regime, the positions of loss maxima are largely
  determined by the individual properties of high index inclusions rather than their
  position and number. Secondly, the spectra of these fibers can be tuned by changing
  the refractive index of the inclusions. In this paper we review transmission properties
  of these fibers and discuss their potential applications for designing tunable photonic
  devices.
