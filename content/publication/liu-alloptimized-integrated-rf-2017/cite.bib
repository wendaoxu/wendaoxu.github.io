 abstract = {We report a silicon nitride chip-based radio-frequency photonic notch filter with an unprecedented performance including an RF gain of 8&#x00A0;dB, a record-low noise figure of 15.6&#x00A0;dB, and a spurious-free dynamic range of 116&#x2009;&#x2009;dB&#x00B7;Hz2/3, with a stop band rejection of 50&#x00A0;dB. This level of performance is achieved by using on-chip resonators&#x2019; unique phase responses, and thorough optimizations of the photonic link. These record results will potentially stimulate future implementations of integrated microwave photonic subsystems for real-world applications.},
