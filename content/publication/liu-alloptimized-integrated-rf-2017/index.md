abstract: We report a silicon nitride chip-based radio-frequency photonic notch filter
  with an unprecedented performance including an RF gain of 8&#x00A0;dB, a record-low
  noise figure of 15.6&#x00A0;dB, and a spurious-free dynamic range of 116&#x2009;&#x2009;dB&#x00B7;Hz2/3,
  with a stop band rejection of 50&#x00A0;dB. This level of performance is achieved
  by using on-chip resonators&#x2019; unique phase responses, and thorough optimizations
  of the photonic link. These record results will potentially stimulate future implementations
  of integrated microwave photonic subsystems for real-world applications.
