abstract: Microwave signal filtering is a fundamental and central functionality in
  radio-frequency (RF) systems. Underpinned by advanced integrated photonics technologies,
  emerging integrated microwave photonic (IMWP) filter platforms enable reconfigurable
  and widely tunable RF signal filtering functionalities that were unattainable using
  conventional electronics while also exhibiting superior features in terms of compactness,
  light weight, stability, low power consumption, and low latency. This paper presents
  a comprehensive review of the principles, architectures, and performance of IMWP
  filters. We highlight recent advances of IMWP filters enabled by on-chip nonlinear
  optics, RF-interference technology and emerging integration platforms, with an emphasis
  on the RF performance which is critical for their usability in real-world applications.
  We conclude with a perspective on future research challenges and new possibilities
  for IMWP filters.
