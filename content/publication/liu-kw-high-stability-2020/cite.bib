 abstract = {High power cladding mode stripper device has been developed in robust configurations, which demonstrated high attenuation and low temperature rise, allowing to remove 2.16 kW of power with efficiency being 21.7 dB. The maximum temperature in packaging did not exceed 55 $^∘$C at a room temperature of 20 $^∘$C. The signal insertion loss was measured to be below 0.05 dB, indicating the ability to strip the cladding light efficiently but keep the core light almost intact. A 40-min stress test has been carried out, which confirmed the working stability and reliability of the proposed cladding mode stripper. Moreover, the device presented is in a compact and closed pack, more than 2 kW of power could be completely dissipated inside a housing with merely 200 mm of length, which could not only be benefit for suppressing nonlinear effects during power delivering but also be easily integrated into high power monolithic fiber laser systems.},
