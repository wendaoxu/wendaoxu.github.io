abstract: High power cladding mode stripper device has been developed in robust configurations,
  which demonstrated high attenuation and low temperature rise, allowing to remove
  2.16 kW of power with efficiency being 21.7 dB. The maximum temperature in packaging
  did not exceed 55 $^∘$C at a room temperature of 20 $^∘$C. The signal insertion
  loss was measured to be below 0.05 dB, indicating the ability to strip the cladding
  light efficiently but keep the core light almost intact. A 40-min stress test has
  been carried out, which confirmed the working stability and reliability of the proposed
  cladding mode stripper. Moreover, the device presented is in a compact and closed
  pack, more than 2 kW of power could be completely dissipated inside a housing with
  merely 200 mm of length, which could not only be benefit for suppressing nonlinear
  effects during power delivering but also be easily integrated into high power monolithic
  fiber laser systems.
