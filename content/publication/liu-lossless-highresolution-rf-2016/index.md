abstract: A novel technique to create a lossless and tunable RF photonic bandstop
  filter with an ultra-high suppression is demonstrated using the combination of an
  overcoupled optical ring resonator and tailored stimulated Brillouin scattering
  gain. The filter bandwidth narrowing is counterintuitively synthesized from two
  broad optical resonance responses. Through a precise amplitude and phase tailoring
  in the optical domain, the RF filter achieves a minimum insertion loss (&lt;0 dB),
  a high isolation (&gt;50 dB), and a tunable 3 dB bandwidth (60--220 MHz) simultaneously
  with wide frequency tunability (1--11 GHz). This ultra-low loss RF filter paves
  the way toward broadband advanced spectrum management with low loss, high selectivity,
  and improved signal-to-noise ratio.
