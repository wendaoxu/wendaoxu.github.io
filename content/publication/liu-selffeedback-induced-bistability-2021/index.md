abstract: The intracavity optical tweezers is a new, to the best of our knowledge,
  cavity optomechanics system, implementing a self-feedback control of the particle's
  position by trapping the particle inside an active ring cavity. This self-feedback
  mechanism efficiently constructs a novel potential in the cavity. Here we predict
  and give experimental evidence for the self-feedback induced optical bistability
  in dual-beam intracavity optical tweezers. Then the characteristics of these bistable
  potential wells are investigated. The results show that we can prevent the bistable
  behaviors from destabilizing the trapping stability through tuning the foci offset
  of two propagating beams in the cavity. This contributes to the use of intracavity
  optical tweezers as a powerful tool for optical manipulation. Importantly, the thermally
  activated transition of the trapped particle in the bistable potential is observed
  for particular experimental parameters. Further investigation of this phenomenon
  could underlie the mechanism of many metastable-related processes in physics, chemistry,
  and biology.
