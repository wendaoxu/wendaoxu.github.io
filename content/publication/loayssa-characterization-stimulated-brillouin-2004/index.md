abstract: We introduce an enhanced method for the characterization of stimulated Brillouin
  scattering (SBS) spectra in single-mode fiber that is based on optical single-sideband
  modulation. This novel technique is shown to provide high-resolution characterization
  of SBS even under saturation operation in a simple and stable setup in which the
  spectrum is translated from the optical to the electrical domain, sweeping the frequency
  of an electrical signal generator. Experimental results are used to demonstrate
  the performance of the system in measuring the detailed structure of acoustic modes
  in three types of single-mode fiber.
