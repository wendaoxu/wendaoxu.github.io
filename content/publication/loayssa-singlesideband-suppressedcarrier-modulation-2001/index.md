abstract: This letter demonstrates a novel optical single-sideband suppressed-carrier
  modulator design using a standard single-electrode Mach-Zehnder electrooptic modulator
  bidirectionally. It is proven that its single-sideband operation is insensitive
  to bias and optical modulation depth. Up to 25 dB of sideband suppression and 14
  dB of optical carrier attenuation are obtained in experiments at microwave modulation
  frequencies. In addition, suppression of dispersion-induced power fading is demonstrated
  in a link with a total dispersion of 2691 ps/nm.
