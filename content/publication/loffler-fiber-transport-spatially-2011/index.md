abstract: Entanglement in the spatial degrees of freedom of photons is an interesting
  resource for quantum information. For practical distribution of such entangled photons,
  it is desirable to use an optical fiber, which in this case has to support multiple
  transverse modes. Here we report the use of a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber
  to transport spatially entangled qubits.
