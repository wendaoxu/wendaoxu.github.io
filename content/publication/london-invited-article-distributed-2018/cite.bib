 abstract = {Forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (F-SBS) is a third-order nonlinear-optical mechanism that couples between two co-propagating optical fields and a guided acoustic mode in a common medium. F-SBS gives rise to nonlinear wave mixing along optical fibers, which adds up with four-wave mixing induced by the Kerr effect. In this work, we report the distributed mapping of nonlinear wave mixing processes involving both mechanisms along standard single-mode fiber, in analysis, simulation, and experiment. Measurements are based on a multi-tone, optical time-domain reflectometry setup, which is highly frequency-selective. The results show that F-SBS leads to nonlinear wave mixing processes that are more complex than those that are driven by the Kerr effect alone. The dynamics are strongly dependent on the exact frequency detuning between optical field components. When the detuning is chosen near an F-SBS resonance, the process becomes asymmetric. Power is coupled from an upper-frequency input pump wave to a lower-frequency one, and the amplification of Stokes-wave sidebands is more pronounced than that of anti-Stokes-wave sidebands. The results are applicable to a new class of distributed fiber-optic sensors, based on F-SBS.},
