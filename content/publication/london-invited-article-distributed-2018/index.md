abstract: Forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (F-SBS) is a third-order nonlinear-optical
  mechanism that couples between two co-propagating optical fields and a guided acoustic
  mode in a common medium. F-SBS gives rise to nonlinear wave mixing along optical
  fibers, which adds up with four-wave mixing induced by the Kerr effect. In this
  work, we report the distributed mapping of nonlinear wave mixing processes involving
  both mechanisms along standard single-mode fiber, in analysis, simulation, and experiment.
  Measurements are based on a multi-tone, optical time-domain reflectometry setup,
  which is highly frequency-selective. The results show that F-SBS leads to nonlinear
  wave mixing processes that are more complex than those that are driven by the Kerr
  effect alone. The dynamics are strongly dependent on the exact frequency detuning
  between optical field components. When the detuning is chosen near an F-SBS resonance,
  the process becomes asymmetric. Power is coupled from an upper-frequency input pump
  wave to a lower-frequency one, and the amplification of Stokes-wave sidebands is
  more pronounced than that of anti-Stokes-wave sidebands. The results are applicable
  to a new class of distributed fiber-optic sensors, based on F-SBS.
