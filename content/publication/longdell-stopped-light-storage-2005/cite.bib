 abstract = {We report on the demonstration of light storage for times greater than a second in praseodymium doped Y2SiO5 using electromagnetically induced transparency. The long storage times were enabled by the long coherence times possible for the hyperfine transitions in this material. The use of a solid-state system also enabled operation with the probe and coupling beam counterpropagating, allowing easy separation of the two beams. The efficiency of the storage was low because of the low optical thickness of the sample; as is discussed, this deficiency should be easy to rectify.},
