abstract: We report on the demonstration of light storage for times greater than a
  second in praseodymium doped Y2SiO5 using electromagnetically induced transparency.
  The long storage times were enabled by the long coherence times possible for the
  hyperfine transitions in this material. The use of a solid-state system also enabled
  operation with the probe and coupling beam counterpropagating, allowing easy separation
  of the two beams. The efficiency of the storage was low because of the low optical
  thickness of the sample; as is discussed, this deficiency should be easy to rectify.
