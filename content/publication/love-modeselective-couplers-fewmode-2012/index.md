abstract: The excitation and separation of individual modes in a few-mode optical
  fiber network can be realized using mode-selective couplers. For excitation at the
  beginning of the fiber, two-core mode-selective couplers can be used, while at the
  end of the fiber, either two- or three-core mode-selective couplers are required
  for demultiplexing of the field symmetric or field asymmetric modes, respectively.
  Both analytical and numerical solutions are presented to quantify the mode-selective
  functionality.
