 abstract = {A simple formula is given for the maximum spot size achievable by downtapering a single-mode fibre, regardless of core profile. When the fundamental-mode field is approximately Gaussian, the maximum taper angle associated with minimal loss of spot-size power on a finite-length taper is the classical diffraction angle for a beam passing through a circular aperture.},
