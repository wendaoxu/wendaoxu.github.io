abstract: A simple formula is given for the maximum spot size achievable by downtapering
  a single-mode fibre, regardless of core profile. When the fundamental-mode field
  is approximately Gaussian, the maximum taper angle associated with minimal loss
  of spot-size power on a finite-length taper is the classical diffraction angle for
  a beam passing through a circular aperture.
