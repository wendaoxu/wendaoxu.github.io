abstract: Two complementary delineation criteria are presented which provide guidelines
  to the design of relatively short, low-loss tapered fibres and devices. They are
  used to explain anomalous loss effects in depressed-cladding and W-fibres, as well
  as the difficulty in fabricating low-loss devices by tapering such fibres. Practical
  application of the criteria to couplers, beam expanders and abrupt taper filters
  is summarised. The accompanying paper provides both experimental and theoretical
  justification for the delineation criteria.$<>$
