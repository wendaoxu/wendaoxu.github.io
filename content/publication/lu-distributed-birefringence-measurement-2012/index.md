abstract: We report a distributed optical fiber birefringence measurement method based
  on homodyne Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR). Unlike conventional
  BOTDR, which requires scanning of the local oscillator to get the Brillouin spectrum,
  instead we propose the beat period measurement of fast and slow components of the
  backscattered Brillouin signal in single-mode fibers using homodyne detection. The
  beat period is measured by detecting the envelope of the Brillouin beat signal,
  which gives the beat length at different fiber locations, so that birefringence
  can be calculated accordingly. The distributed birefringence of a 1.7&#xA0;km SMF-28
  and a 4.3&#xA0;km large-effective-area fiber were measured with 0.6&#xA0;m spatial
  resolution without frequency scanning of the Brillouin spectrum.
