 abstract = {We describe the design and fabrication of a photonic bandgap fiber formed with two different glasses. As in a hollow-core fiber, light is guided in a low-index core region because of the antiresonances of the high-index strands in the fiber cladding. The structure described represents an ideal bandgap fiber that exhibits no interface modes and guides over the full width of multiple bandgaps.},
