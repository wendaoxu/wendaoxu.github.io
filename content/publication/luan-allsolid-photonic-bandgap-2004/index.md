abstract: We describe the design and fabrication of a photonic bandgap fiber formed
  with two different glasses. As in a hollow-core fiber, light is guided in a low-index
  core region because of the antiresonances of the high-index strands in the fiber
  cladding. The structure described represents an ideal bandgap fiber that exhibits
  no interface modes and guides over the full width of multiple bandgaps.
