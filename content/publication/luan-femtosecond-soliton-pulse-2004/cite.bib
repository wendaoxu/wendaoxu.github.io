 abstract = {We describe delivery of femtosecond solitons at 800nm wavelength over five meters of hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber. The output pulses had a length of less than 300fs and an output pulse energy of around 65nJ, and were almost bandwidth limited. Numerical modeling shows that the nonlinear phase shift is determined by both the nonlinearity of air and by the overlap of the guided mode with the glass.},
