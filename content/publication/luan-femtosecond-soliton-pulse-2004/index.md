abstract: We describe delivery of femtosecond solitons at 800nm wavelength over five
  meters of hollow-core photonic bandgap fiber. The output pulses had a length of
  less than 300fs and an output pulse energy of around 65nJ, and were almost bandwidth
  limited. Numerical modeling shows that the nonlinear phase shift is determined by
  both the nonlinearity of air and by the overlap of the guided mode with the glass.
