abstract: We investigate hollow-core fibers for fiber delivery of high power ultrashort
  laser pulses. We use numerical techniques to design an anti-resonant hollow-core
  fiber having one layer of non-touching tubes to determine which structures offer
  the best optical properties for the delivery of high power picosecond pulses. A
  novel fiber with 7 tubes and a core of 30&#x000B5;m was fabricated and it is here
  described and characterized, showing remarkable low loss, low bend loss, and good
  mode quality. Its optical properties are compared to both a 10&#x000B5;m and a 18&#x000B5;m
  core diameter photonic band gap hollow-core fiber. The three fibers are characterized
  experimentally for the delivery of 22 picosecond pulses at 1032nm. We demonstrate
  flexible, diffraction limited beam delivery with output average powers in excess
  of 70W.
