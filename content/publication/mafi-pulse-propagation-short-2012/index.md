abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the modal properties, dispersive behavior,
  and nonlinear mode coupling in graded-index multimode fibers (GIMFs), and lay out
  a simplified form of a generalized nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation, which can be
  used to explore the rich nonlinear dynamics related to the propagation and interaction
  of light pulses in GIMFs in a tractable manner. We also briefly discuss an application
  of the presented formalism in the study of four-wave mixing in these fibers. While
  the reported formalism is fairly general, our presentation is mainly targeted at
  device applications in which short segments of GIMFs are used.
