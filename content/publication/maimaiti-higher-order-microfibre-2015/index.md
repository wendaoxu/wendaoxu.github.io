abstract: Optical manipulation in the vicinity of optical micro- and nanofibres has
  shown potential across several fields in recent years, including microparticle control
  and cold atom probing and trapping. To date, most work has focussed on the propagation
  of the fundamental mode through the fibre. However, along the maximum mode intensity
  axis, higher order modes have a longer evanescent field extension and larger field
  amplitude at the fibre waist compared to the fundamental mode, opening up new possibilities
  for optical manipulation and particle trapping. We demonstrate a microfibre/optical
  tweezers compact system for trapping and propelling dielectric particles based on
  the excitation of the first group of higher order modes at the fibre waist. Speed
  enhancement of polystyrene particle propulsion was observed for the higher order
  modes compared to the fundamental mode for particles ranging from 1>$μ$m to 5>$μ$m
  in diameter. The optical propelling velocity of a single, 3>$μ$m polystyrene particle
  was found to be 8 times faster under the higher order mode than the fundamental
  mode field for a waist power of 25>mW. Experimental data are supported by theoretical
  calculations. This work can be extended to trapping and manipulation of laser-cooled
  atoms with potential for quantum networks.
