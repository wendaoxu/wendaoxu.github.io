 abstract = {Single picosecond pulses have been amplified to the terawatt level by a table-top-size Nd:glass amplifier by using the technique of chirped pulse amplification (CPA). The divergence of the beam is twice the diffraction limit, making the brightness of this source equal to approximately 2*10/sup +18/ W/(cm-sr), which is thought to be the highest brightness yet reported. The CPA technique allows the efficient energy extraction from extremely compact amplifier systems. Amplification of chirped pulses over nine orders of magnitude, i.e. from nanojoule to the joule level, has been demonstrated.$<>$},
