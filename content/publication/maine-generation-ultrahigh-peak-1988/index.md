abstract: Single picosecond pulses have been amplified to the terawatt level by a
  table-top-size Nd:glass amplifier by using the technique of chirped pulse amplification
  (CPA). The divergence of the beam is twice the diffraction limit, making the brightness
  of this source equal to approximately 2*10/sup +18/ W/(cm-sr), which is thought
  to be the highest brightness yet reported. The CPA technique allows the efficient
  energy extraction from extremely compact amplifier systems. Amplification of chirped
  pulses over nine orders of magnitude, i.e. from nanojoule to the joule level, has
  been demonstrated.$<>$
