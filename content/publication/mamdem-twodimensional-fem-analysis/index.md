abstract: The analysis of optical and acoustic properties of optical fibers is required
  for accurate Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) determination. We present a full modal-analysis
  of the guided optical and acoustic modes based on a two-dimensional finite-element
  method (2D-FEM) for BGS calculation using COMSOL Multiphysics. We believe that this
  method will be helpful in analyzing and designing special fibers for applications,
  such as fiber amplifiers with significant SBS (Stimulated Brillouin Scattering)
  suppression or Brillouin-based fiber sensors. The model is adapted for BGS evaluation
  of any single mode fiber (in term of optical mode) based on its profile, namely
  its geometry, and its doping composition. Compared to standard multi-layer methods
  limited to axially-symmetric fibers [1], the 2D-FEM analysis enables the BGS computation
  even for more complicated geometries, such as PANDA polarization-maintaining fiber
  where the optical index and the material stress are azimuthally dependant. The results
  of numerical modeling have shown good agreement with measured Brillouin spectra
  for different types of silica fibers. Examples are given for a standard GeO2-doped
  core fiber (standard fiber for telecommunication applications), Fluor-doped cladding
  fiber (acoustic anti-waveguide) and PANDA fiber.
