abstract: We explore the viability of laboratory-scale mechanical resonators as detectors
  for ultralight scalar dark matter. The signal we investigate is an atomic strain
  due to modulation of the fine structure constant and the lepton mass at the Compton
  frequency of dark matter particles. The resulting stress can drive an elastic body
  with acoustic breathing modes, producing displacements that are accessible with
  opto- or electromechanical readout techniques. To address the unknown mass of dark
  matter particles (which determines their Compton frequency), we consider various
  resonator designs operating at kHz to MHz frequencies, corresponding to $10textasciicircum-12-10textasciicircum-5$
  eV particle mass. Current resonant-mass gravitational wave detectors that have been
  repurposed as dark matter detectors weigh $sim ! 10textasciicircum3$ kg. We find
  that a large unexplored parameter space can be accessed with ultra-high-$Q$, cryogenically-cooled,
  cm-scale mechanical resonators possessing $sim ! 10textasciicircum7$ times smaller
  mass.
