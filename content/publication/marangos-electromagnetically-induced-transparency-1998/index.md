abstract: 'The subject of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is reviewed
  in this paper. Emphasis is placed on the experimental work reported in this field
  since 1990. Theoretical work is also covered, although it is not intended to review
  all the very numerous recent theoretical treatments on this topic. The basic physical
  ideas behind EIT are elucidated. The relation of EIT to other processes involving
  laser-induced atomic coherence, such as coherent population trapping, coherent adiabatic
  population transfer and lasing without inversion, is discussed. Experimental work
  is described covering the following topics: EIT with pulsed and continuous-wave
  sources, lasing without inversion, pulse propagation in a laser dressed medium and
  EIT in nonlinear optical processes. A full set of references and a bibliography
  are included.'
