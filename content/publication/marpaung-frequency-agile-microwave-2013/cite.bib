 abstract = {We report a novel class microwave photonic (MWP) notch filter with a very narrow isolation bandwidth (10&#xA0;MHz), an ultrahigh stopband rejection (&gt;60&#x2009;&#x2009;dB), a wide frequency tuning (1&#x2013;30&#xA0;GHz), and flexible bandwidth reconfigurability (10&#x2013;65&#xA0;MHz). This performance is enabled by a new concept of sideband amplitude and phase controls using an electro-optic modulator and an optical filter. This concept enables energy efficient operation in active MWP notch filters, and opens up a pathway toward enabling low-power nanophotonic devices as high-performance RF filters.},
