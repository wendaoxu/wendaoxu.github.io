abstract: Recent advances in photonic integration have propelled microwave photonic
  technologies to new heights. The ability to interface hybrid material platforms
  to enhance light--matter interactions has led to the development of ultra-small
  and high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators, low-noise frequency synthesizers and
  chip signal processors with orders-of-magnitude enhanced spectral resolution. On
  the other hand, the maturity of high-volume semiconductor processing has finally
  enabled the complete integration of light sources, modulators and detectors in a
  single microwave photonic processor chip and has ushered the creation of a complex
  signal processor with multifunctionality and reconfigurability similar to electronic
  devices. Here, we review these recent advances and discuss the impact of these new
  frontiers for short- and long-term applications in communications and information
  processing. We also take a look at the future perspectives at the intersection of
  integrated microwave photonics and other fields including quantum and neuromorphic
  photonics.
