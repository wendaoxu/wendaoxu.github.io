abstract: Highly selective and reconfigurable microwave filters are of great importance
  in radio-frequency signal processing. Microwave photonic (MWP) filters are of particular
  interest, as they offer flexible reconfiguration and an order of magnitude higher
  frequency tuning range than electronic filters. However, all MWP filters to date
  have been limited by trade-offs between key parameters such as tuning range, resolution,
  and suppression. This problem is exacerbated in the case of integrated MWP filters,
  blocking the path to compact, high-performance filters. Here we show the first chip-based
  MWP bandstop filter with ultrahigh suppression, high resolution in the megahertz
  range, and 0&#x2013;30&#xA0;GHz frequency tuning. This record performance was achieved
  using an ultralow Brillouin gain from a compact photonic chip and a novel approach
  of optical resonance-assisted RF signal cancellation. The results point to new ways
  of creating energy-efficient and reconfigurable integrated MWP signal processors
  for wireless communications and defence applications.
