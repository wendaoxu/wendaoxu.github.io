abstract: We consider some features of spatial solitary-wave switching in a unidirectional
  ring cavity that is partially filled with a fast and saturably self-focusing nonlinear
  medium. Large (part-beam switched) solitary arrays are considered. It is found that
  prescribed binary patterns may be encoded in the duration of a single cavity transit
  and subsequently remain stable over thousands of transits. Beam interrupt allows
  pixels to be switched off in fewer than ten cavity transits. Pixel instabilities
  on an unpixelated beam are shown to arise from spatial solitary attractive forces
  and intensity gradients.
