abstract: Quantification of optical absorption gaps in nailfold capillaries has recently
  shown promise as a non-invasive technique for neutropenia screening. Here we demonstrate
  a low-cost, portable attachment to a mobile phone that can resolve optical absorption
  gaps in nailfold capillaries using a reverse lens technique and oblique 520nm illumination.
  Resolution &lt;4&#x03BC;m within a 1mm2 on-axis region is demonstrated, and wide
  field of view (3.5mm &#x00D7; 4.8mm) imaging is achieved with resolution &lt;6&#x03BC;m
  in the periphery. Optical absorption gaps (OAGs) are visible in superficial capillary
  loops of a healthy human participant by an &#x223C;8-fold difference in contrast-to-noise
  ratio with respect to red blood cell absorption contrast. High speed video capillaroscopy
  up to 240 frames per second (fps) is possible, though 60fps is sufficient to resolve
  an average frequency of 37 OAGs/minute passing through nailfold capillaries. The
  simplicity and portability of this technique may enable the development of an effective
  non-invasive tool for white blood cell screening in point-of-care and global health
  settings.
