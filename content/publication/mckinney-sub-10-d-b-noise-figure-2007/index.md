abstract: We present the first microwave analog optical link to achieve a noise figure
  (NF) below 10 dB. A link gain of up to 6dB and common-mode noise rejection achieved
  via a dual-output Mach-Zehnder intensity modulator and differential detection enable
  us to achieve link NFs as low as 7.5 dB in the range of 2-6.5 GHz
