abstract: Production defects and external perturbations cause standard telecommunication
  fibers to be randomly birefringent. Fiber birefringence is the origin of the well-known
  polarization mode dispersion (PMD), which degrades system performances. The knowledge
  of birefringence properties may be crucial, especially when problems like development
  of low-PMD fibers or PMD interaction with optical nonlinearities in very high-capacity
  systems are faced. Some techniques are known to measure birefringence, and useful
  results have been obtained for both installed and wound-on-drum fibers. However,measurement
  of the circular component of birefringence still presents difficulties. In this
  paper, a new method for circular birefringence measurement is proposed that applies
  to long single-mode twisted fibers. The technique is based on polarization-sensitive
  optical time-domain reflectometry. Experimental results are in good agreement with
  the theoretical analysis.
