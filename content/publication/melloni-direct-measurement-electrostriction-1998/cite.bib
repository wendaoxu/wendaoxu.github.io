 abstract = {The electrostriction contribution to the nonlinear refractive index in optical fiber was theoretically calculated and measured. Nonlinearity was induced directly by insertion of the optical fiber into an intense external electric field. With this technique both the Kerr and the electrostrictive contributions to the intensity dependence of the nonlinear refractive index in a step-index fiber were measured. Good agreement between calculated and measured values was observed. These results should confirm and explain the differences observed in measurement of n2 at different bit rates.},
