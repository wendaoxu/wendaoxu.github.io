abstract: The electrostriction contribution to the nonlinear refractive index in optical
  fiber was theoretically calculated and measured. Nonlinearity was induced directly
  by insertion of the optical fiber into an intense external electric field. With
  this technique both the Kerr and the electrostrictive contributions to the intensity
  dependence of the nonlinear refractive index in a step-index fiber were measured.
  Good agreement between calculated and measured values was observed. These results
  should confirm and explain the differences observed in measurement of n2 at different
  bit rates.
