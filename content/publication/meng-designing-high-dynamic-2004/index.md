abstract: A tutorial review to design high-performance microwave photonic links is
  presented. The link performance is analyzed in detail in terms of the link gain,
  noise figure, and dynamic range. The two-port microwave network is used to model
  fiber optic links, which takes full advantage of microwave circuit analysis. We
  have also examined and compared several kinds of noise suppression techniques on
  the basis of balanced and/or carrier filtering schemes to achieve maximum dynamic
  range.
