abstract: Strong acousto-optic interaction in high-index waveguides and cavities generally
  requires the releasing of the high-index core to avoid mechanical leakage into the
  underlying low-index substrate. This complicates fabrication, limits thermalization,
  reduces the mechanical robustness, and hinders large-area optomechanical devices
  on a single chip. Here, we overcome this limitation by employing vertical photonic-phononic
  engineering to drastically reduce mechanical leakage into the cladding by adding
  a pedestal with specific properties between the core and the cladding. We apply
  this concept to a silicon-based platform, due to the remarkable properties of silicon
  to enhance optomechanical interactions and the technological relevance of silicon
  devices in multiple applications. Specifically, the insertion of a thick silicon
  nitride layer between the silicon guiding core and the silica substrate contributes
  to reducing gigahertz-frequency phonon leakage while enabling large values of the
  Brillouin gain in an unreleased platform. We numerically obtain values of the Brillouin
  gain around 300(W m)-1 for different configurations, which could be further increased
  by operation at cryogenic temperatures. These values should enable Brillouin-related
  phenomena in centimeter-scale waveguides or in more compact ring resonators. Our
  findings could pave the way toward large-area unreleased-cavity and waveguide optomechanics
  on silicon and other high-index photonic technologies.
