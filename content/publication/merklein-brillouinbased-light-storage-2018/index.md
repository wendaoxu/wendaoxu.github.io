abstract: Storing or delaying optical signals is of key interest for fundamental research
  and applications in radar, microwave signal processing, quantum information as well
  as optical communication systems. Delay systems based on stimulated Brillouin scattering
  (SBS), a coherent interaction between optical and acoustic waves can be implemented
  in optical fiber or chip-scale platforms, operate at room temperature and can be
  fully controlled via the optical pump wave. In this article, we review delay and
  storage techniques based on SBS. We present SBS slow-light, fiber delay lines based
  on Brillouin dynamic gratings, Brillouin quasi-light storage and Brillouin-based
  light storage via photon-phonon conversion and compare their performance. In this
  process, we also include an overview of different platforms used for Brillouin light
  storage and delay schemes, such as optical fiber, planar soft-glass waveguides,
  and silica fiber-tip resonators.
