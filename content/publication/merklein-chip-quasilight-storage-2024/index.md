abstract: Efficient and extended light storage mechanisms are pivotal in photonics,
  particularly in optical communications, microwave photonics, and quantum networks,
  as they offer a direct route to circumvent electrical conversion losses and surmount
  bandwidth constraints. Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) is an established method
  to store optical information by transferring it to the acoustic domain, but current
  on-chip SBS efforts have limited bandwidth or storage time due to the phonon lifetime
  of several nanoseconds. An alternate approach known as quasi-light storage (QLS),
  which involves the creation of delayed replicas of optical data pulses via SBS in
  conjunction with a frequency comb, has been proposed to lift the storage time constraint;
  however, its realization has been confined to lengthy optical fibers, constraining
  integration with on-chip optical elements and form factors. Here, we present an
  experimental demonstration of QLS on a photonic chip leveraging the large SBS gain
  of chalcogenide glass, achieving delays of up to 500~ns for 1~ns long signal pulses,
  surpassing typical Brillouin storage processes' acoustic lifetime by more than an
  order of magnitude and waveguide transit time by two orders of magnitude. We experimentally
  and numerically investigate the dynamics of on-chip QLS and reveal that the interplay
  between the acoustic wave that stores the optical signal and subsequent optical
  pump pulses leads to a reshaping of the acoustic field. Our demonstrations illustrate
  the potential for achieving ultra-long storage times of individual pulses by several
  hundred pulse widths, marking a significant stride toward advancing the field of
  all-optical storage and delay mechanisms.
