abstract: Controlling and manipulating quanta of coherent acoustic vibrations---phonons---in
  integrated circuits has recently drawn a lot of attention, since phonons can function
  as unique links between radiofrequency and optical signals, allow access to quantum
  regimes and offer advanced signal processing capabilities. Recent approaches based
  on optomechanical resonators have achieved impressive quality factors allowing for
  storage of optical signals. However, so far these techniques have been limited in
  bandwidth and are incompatible with multi-wavelength operation. In this work, we
  experimentally demonstrate a coherent buffer in an integrated planar optical waveguide
  by transferring the optical information coherently to an acoustic hypersound wave.
  Optical information is extracted using the reverse process. These hypersound phonons
  have similar wavelengths as the optical photons but travel at five orders of magnitude
  lower velocity. We demonstrate the storage of phase and amplitude of optical information
  with gigahertz bandwidth and show operation at separate wavelengths with negligible
  cross-talk.
