abstract: The last few years have seen major progress in harnessing on-chip photon-phonon
  interactions, leading to a wide range of demonstrations of new functionalities.
  Utilizing not only the optical response of a nonlinear waveguide-but also acoustic
  resonances-enables the realization of microwave devices with unprecedented performance,
  otherwise hard to achieve in all-optical processing schemes or electronically. Here,
  we overview on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) with special emphasis
  on microwave sources and microwave signal processing schemes. We review the different
  material platforms and structures for on-chip SBS, ranging from chalcogenide rib
  waveguides to hybrid silicon/silicon-nitride structures, high-Q photonic-phononic
  silica microresonators, and suspended silicon nanowires. We show that the paradigm
  shift in SBS research-from long length of fibers to chip-scale devices-is now moving
  toward fully integrated photonic-phononic CMOS chips.
