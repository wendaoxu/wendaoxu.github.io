abstract: Spectrally pure microwave sources are highly desired for sev-eral applications,
  ranging from wireless communication to next generation radar technology and metrology.
  Additionally, to generate very pure signals at even higher frequencies, these ad-vanced
  microwave sources have to be compact, low in weight, and low energy consumption
  to comply with in-field applica-tions. A hybrid optical and electronic cavity, known
  as an opto-electronic oscillator (OEO), has the potential to leverage the high bandwidth
  of optics to generate ultrapure high-frequency microwave signals. Here we present
  a widely tunable, low phase noise microwave source based on a photonic chip. Using
  on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering as a narrow-band active filter allows single-mode
  OEO operation and ultrawide frequency tunability with no signal degeneration. Furthermore,
  we show very low close-to-carrier phase noise. This Letter paves the way to a compact,
  fully integrated pure microwave source.
