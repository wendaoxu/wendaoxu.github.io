abstract: In this paper, we propose an in-process measurement method of the diameter
  of micro-optical fiber such as a tapered optical fiber. The proposed technique is
  based on analyzing optically scattered light generated by standing wave illumination.
  The proposed method is significant in that it requires an only limited measurement
  range and does not require a high dynamic range sensor. These properties are suitable
  for in-process measurement. This experiment verified that the proposed method could
  measure a fiber diameter as stable as,textpm,0.01~$Î¼$m under an air turbulence environment.
  As a result of comparing the measured diameter distribution with those by scanning
  electron microscopy, it was confirmed that the proposed method has a measurement
  accuracy better than several hundred nanometers.
