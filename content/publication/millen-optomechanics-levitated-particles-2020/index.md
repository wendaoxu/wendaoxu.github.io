abstract: Optomechanics is concerned with the use of light to control mechanical objects.
  As a field, it has been hugely successful in the production of precise and novel
  sensors, the development of low-dissipation nanomechanical devices, and the manipulation
  of quantum signals. Micro- and nano-particles levitated in optical fields act as
  nanoscale oscillators, making them excellent low-dissipation optomechanical objects,
  with minimal thermal contact to the environment when operating in vacuum. Levitated
  optomechanics is seen as the most promising route for studying high-mass quantum
  physics, with the promise of creating macroscopically separated superposition states
  at masses of 106 amu and above. Optical feedback, both using active monitoring or
  the passive interaction with an optical cavity, can be used to cool the centre-of-mass
  of levitated nanoparticles well below 1 mK, paving the way to operation in the quantum
  regime. In addition, trapped mesoscopic particles are the paradigmatic system for
  studying nanoscale stochastic processes, and have already demonstrated their utility
  in state-of-the-art force sensing.
