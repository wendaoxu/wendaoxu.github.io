abstract: Linearly polarized (LP) modes in few-mode fibers are not true eigenmodes
  but approximated modes constituting of linear combinations of true eigenmodes. Therefore,
  the vector field profile in a few-mode fiber must be expressed in terms of the true
  eigenmodes with complex amplitudes involving a phase difference corresponding to
  the propagation distance. Owing to this property of LP mode propagation, the propagation
  characteristics of few-mode fibers cannot be accurately analyzed using conventional
  LP modes. In this study, the crosstalk between LP11 quasi-degenerate modes due to
  offset connection is accurately analyzed using matrix formalism expressing the linear
  combination of true eigenmodes. The difference in the analytical results between
  the LP modes and the eigenmodes revealed that the propagation of few-mode fibers
  should be analyzed using true eigenmodes.
