abstract: This paper reports narrowing and splitting of 7-ps-duration pulses from
  a mode-locked color-center laser by a 700-m-long, single-mode silica-glass fiber,
  at a wavelength (1.55 $Î¼$m) of loss and large but negative group-velocity dispersion.
  At certain critical power levels, the observed behavior is characteristic of solitons.
