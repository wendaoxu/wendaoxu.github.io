abstract: 'General propagation properties and universal curves are given for doubly
  clad single-mode fibers with inner cladding index higher or lower than outer cladding
  index, using the two parameters: inner cladding/core radii ratio and inner cladding/core
  index differences ratio. LPO1, LP11, and LPO2 cutoff conditions are examined. It
  is shown that dispersion properties largely differ from the singly clad single-mode
  fiber case, leading to large new possibilities for low-loss dispersion-free fibers
  at any wavelength between 1.3 and 1.7 $Î¼$m.'
