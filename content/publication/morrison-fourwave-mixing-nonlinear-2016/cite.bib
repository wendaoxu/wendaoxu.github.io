 abstract = {o̧pyright 2016 Optical Society of America.  We experimentally investigate four-wave mixing and nonlinear losses in low-loss 3 $μ$m thick silicon strip waveguides. Adiabatic bends allow for single-mode operation in an ultra-compact 35 cm long spiral. The waveguides exhibited reduced nonlinear losses due to the large mode area of 2.75 $μ$m 2 . The nonlinear coefficient $γ$ was measured as 5.5 m -1 W -1 . These features, along with the low propagation loss of 0.17 dB/cm, enable large idler power generation at 1550 nm.},
