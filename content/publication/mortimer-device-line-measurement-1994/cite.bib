 abstract = {A device for on-line measurements of fiber birefringence is described. The system consists of a double beam detection method coupled to an interference fringe device, allowing a quasi-simultaneous measurement of the diameter. A sensitive determination of birefringence is possible using this method. An example is given of an application to a fiber spun from a solution of cellulose in aqueous N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide.},
