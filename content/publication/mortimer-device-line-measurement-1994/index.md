abstract: A device for on-line measurements of fiber birefringence is described. The
  system consists of a double beam detection method coupled to an interference fringe
  device, allowing a quasi-simultaneous measurement of the diameter. A sensitive determination
  of birefringence is possible using this method. An example is given of an application
  to a fiber spun from a solution of cellulose in aqueous N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide.
