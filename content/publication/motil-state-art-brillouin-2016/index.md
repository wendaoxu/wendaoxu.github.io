abstract: "Fiber-optic distributed sensing, employing the Brillouin effect, is already
  a commercially available measurement technique for the accurate estimation of the
  static strain/temperature fields along tens of kilometers with a spatial resolution
  of the order of a meter. Furthermore, relentless research efforts are paving the
  way to even much wider usability of the technique through recently achieved enhanced
  performance in each of its critical dimensions: measurement range has been extended
  to hundreds of kilometers; spatial resolution is of the order of a centimeter or
  less, signal to noise ratio has been significantly improved; fast dynamic events
  can be captured at kHz's sampling rates; and a much better understanding of the
  underlying physics has been obtained, along with the formulation of figures of merit,
  and the preparation and early adoption of appropriate standards and guidelines.
  This paper describes the basics, as well as the state of the art, of the leading
  Brillouin interrogation methods, with emphasis on the significant progress made
  in the last 3 years. It also includes a short introduction to coding, which has
  proven instrumental in many of the recently obtained performance records."
