abstract: We systematically study different approaches to introduce high birefringence
  and high polarization extinction ratio in hollow core antiresonant fibers. Having
  shown the ineffectiveness of elliptical cores to induce large birefringence in hollow
  core fibers, we focus on designing and optimizing polarization maintaining Hollow
  Core Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fibers (HC-NANF). In a first approach, we create
  and exploit anti-crossings with glass modes at different wavelengths for the two
  polarizations. We show that suitable low loss high birefringence regions can be
  obtained by appropriately modifying the thickness of tubes along one direction while
  leaving the tubes in the orthogonal direction unchanged and in antiresonance. Using
  this concept, we propose a new birefringent NANF design providing low loss (~40dB/km)
  and high birefringence (&gt;10&#x2212;4) over a record bandwidth of ~550nm, and
  discuss how bandwidth can be traded off to further reduce the loss to a few dB/km.
  Finally, we propose a polarization mode-stripping technique in the birefringent
  NANF. As a demonstration, we propose a polarizing birefringent NANF design that
  can achieve orthogonal polarization loss ratios as large as 30dB over the C-band
  while eliminating any undesirable polarization coupling effect thereby resulting
  in a single polarization output in a hollow core fiber regardless of the input polarization
  state.
