abstract: Ceramists are constantly looking for materials to be used as dielectric
  resonators in the telecommunication industry. These applications require materials
  with ∊ r $∼$ 4 -- 120, Q × f 0 &gt; 10 000 GHz and $τ$ f $∼$ 0 ppm K -1 . Additionally,
  efforts are also underway to lower the sintering temperatures (e. g. $łeq$ 800 $^∘$C)
  to reduce processing and electrode costs. The simultaneous achievement of all the
  three properties mentioned above is difficult; nevertheless, some materials have
  been synthesized fulfilling the criteria for microwave applications. This study
  is an overview of various studies on materials for possible applications as microwave
  dielectrics and factors affecting their microwave properties. These factors include
  crystal structure, defects, fabrication route, and the type and concentration of
  substituents and additives.
