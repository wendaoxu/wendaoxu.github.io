abstract: 'We demonstrate spatiotemporally mode-locked and phase-independent turnkey
  Kerr soliton microcomb through backward Brillouin effect, as well as coexisting
  forward Brillouin lasers with squeezed phase noise, based on an ultrahigh-quality-factor
  Fabry-Perot microresonator made of multimode fiber.Authors: M. Nie, S. Huang, University
