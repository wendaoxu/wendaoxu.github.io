abstract: The development of hollow core photonic crystal fibers with low losses over
  a broad spectral region in the near IR enabled the demonstration of a novel laser
  type - Hollow-core Optical Fiber Gas Laser (HOFGLAS). The laser combines attractive
  features of fiber lasers such as compactness and long interaction length of pump
  and laser radiation with those of gas lasers such as the potential for high output
  power and narrow line width. This paper summarizes recent developments and describes
  the demonstration of C2H2 and HCN prototype lasers. Avenues to extend laser emission
  further into the IR are discussed.
