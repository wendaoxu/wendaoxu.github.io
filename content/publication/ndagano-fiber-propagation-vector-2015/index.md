abstract: Here we employ both dynamic and geometric phase control of light to produce
  radially modulated vector-vortex modes, the natural modes of optical fibers. We
  then measure these modes using a vector modal decomposition set-up as well as a
  tomography measurement, the latter providing a degree of the non-separability of
  the vector states, akin to an entanglement measure for quantum states. We demonstrate
  the versatility of the approach by creating the natural modes of a step-index fiber,
  which are known to exhibit strong mode coupling, and measure the modal cross-talk
  and non-separability decay during propagation. Our approach will be useful in mode
  division multiplexing schemes for transport of classical and quantum states.
