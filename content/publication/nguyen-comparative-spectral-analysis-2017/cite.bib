 abstract = {COMPARATIVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE MODELS: THE EULER-BERNOULLI BEAM MODEL, THE RAYLEIGH BEAM MODEL, AND THE TIMOSHENKO BEAM MODEL By Anhhong Rose Nguyen University of New Hampshire, December, 2017 We derive herein approximate spectra for three different models of transversely vibrating beams. Each model consists of a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) with various boundary conditions. The three models that we consider are the Euler-Bernoulli model, the Rayleigh model, and the Timoshenko model. We first discuss a brief history of the models before delving into obtaining the spectral equations for each beam model under different boundary conditions. Lastly, we present asymptotic approximations of some of the various spectral equations we found from each model.},
