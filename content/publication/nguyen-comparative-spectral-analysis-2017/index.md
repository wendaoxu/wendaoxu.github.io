abstract: 'COMPARATIVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE MODELS: THE EULER-BERNOULLI
  BEAM MODEL, THE RAYLEIGH BEAM MODEL, AND THE TIMOSHENKO BEAM MODEL By Anhhong Rose
  Nguyen University of New Hampshire, December, 2017 We derive herein approximate
  spectra for three different models of transversely vibrating beams. Each model consists
  of a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) with various boundary conditions.
  The three models that we consider are the Euler-Bernoulli model, the Rayleigh model,
  and the Timoshenko model. We first discuss a brief history of the models before
  delving into obtaining the spectral equations for each beam model under different
  boundary conditions. Lastly, we present asymptotic approximations of some of the
  various spectral equations we found from each model.'
