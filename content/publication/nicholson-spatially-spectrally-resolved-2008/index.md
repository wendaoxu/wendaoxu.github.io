abstract: A new measurement technique, capable of quantifying the number and type
  of modes propagating in large-mode-area fibers is both proposed and demonstrated.
  The measurement is based on both spatially and spectrally resolving the image of
  the output of the fiber under test. The measurement provides high quality images
  of the modes that can be used to identify the mode order, while at the same time
  returning the power levels of the higher-order modes relative to the fundamental
  mode. Alternatively the data can be used to provide statistics on the level of beam
  pointing instability and mode shape changes due to random uncontrolled fluctuations
  of the phases between the coherent modes propagating in the fiber. An added advantage
  of the measurement is that is requires no prior detailed knowledge of the fiber
  properties in order to identify the modes and quantify their relative power levels.
  Because of the coherent nature of the measurement, it is far more sensitive to changes
  in beam properties due to the mode content in the beam than is the more traditional
  M2 measurement for characterizing beam quality. We refer to the measurement as Spatially
  and Spectrally resolved imaging of mode content in fibers, or more simply as S2
  imaging.
