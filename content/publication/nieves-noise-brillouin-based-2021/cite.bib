 abstract = {We theoretically and numerically study the efficiency of Brillouin-based opto-acoustic data storage in a photonic waveguide in the presence of thermal noise and laser phase noise. We compare the physics of the noise processes and how they affect different storage techniques, examining both amplitude and phase storage schemes. We investigate the effects of storage time and pulse properties on the quality of the retrieved signal and find that phase storage is less sensitive to thermal noise than amplitude storage.},
