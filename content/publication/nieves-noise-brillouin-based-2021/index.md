abstract: We theoretically and numerically study the efficiency of Brillouin-based
  opto-acoustic data storage in a photonic waveguide in the presence of thermal noise
  and laser phase noise. We compare the physics of the noise processes and how they
  affect different storage techniques, examining both amplitude and phase storage
  schemes. We investigate the effects of storage time and pulse properties on the
  quality of the retrieved signal and find that phase storage is less sensitive to
  thermal noise than amplitude storage.
