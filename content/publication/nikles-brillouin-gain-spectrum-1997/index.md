abstract: A novel method for Brillouin gain spectrum measurements in optical fibers
  is presented. It is based on the pump and probe technique with the specificity to
  use a single laser source together with an external modulator to generate the interacting
  lightwaves. The high accuracy and inherent stability of the technique makes it suitable
  for calibration and reference measurements. Different fibers with different refractive
  index profiles have been tested and characterized. The problem of the evolution
  of the polarization of the interacting waves is addressed in the article and a polarization
  insensitive determination of the actual Brillouin gain coefficient is made possible
  through two successive measurements with different polarizations. The effects of
  strain and temperature on the Brillouin gain spectrum are also fully characterized.
