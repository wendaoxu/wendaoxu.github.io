abstract: Polarization-maintaining fibers and their applications are reviewed. The
  classification of high-birefringent fibers and low-birefringent fibers and their
  fabrication methods and characteristics are discussed in Section II. Analytical
  methods and numerical methods for fiber design on the birefringence are presented
  in Section III. Degradation factors of polarization maintenance expressed as crosstalk
  or mode-coupling parameters caused by internal origins such as structural imperfections,
  wavelength, and nonlinear effects, and by external origins such as temperature fluctuations,
  mechanical perturbations, and electromagnetic effects, are discussed in Section
  IV. Characterization methods on beat length, mode coupling, stress distribution,
  and mechanical strength are presented in Section V. Applications to the fiber devices
  and nonlinear effects, and splicing methods for the polarization-maintaining fibers
  are described in Sections VI and VII.
