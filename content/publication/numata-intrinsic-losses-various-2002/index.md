abstract: We systematically measured the intrinsic mechanical quality factors of 13
  kinds of bulk fused silica from four companies using a nodal support system. Some
  of them have actually been adopted as mirror substrates in interferometric gravitational
  wave detectors. The measured quality factors widely ranged from 7 × 105 to 4 × 107.
  They turned out to be independent of one specific property, such as the amount of
  OH content, suggesting that the loss mechanism has several origins. We found that
  many of the samples showed smaller losses at lower frequency. From the viewpoint
  of the mirror thermal noise, it would be fortunate if the loss continued to decrease
  with decreasing frequency. We also found that an annealing process increases their
  quality factors.
