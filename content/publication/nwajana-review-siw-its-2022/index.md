abstract: Substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) is a modern day (21st century) transmission
  line that has recently been developed. This technology has introduced new possibilities
  to the design of efficient circuits and components operating in the radio frequency
  (RF) and microwave frequency spectrum. Microstrip components are very good for low
  frequency applications but are ineffective at extreme frequencies, and involve rigorous
  fabrication concessions in the implementation of RF, microwave, and millimeter-wave
  components. This is due to wavelengths being short at higher frequencies. Waveguide
  devices, on the other hand, are ideal for higher frequency systems, but are very
  costly, hard to fabricate, and challenging to integrate with planar components in
  the neighborhood. SIW connects the gap that existed between conventional air-filled
  rectangular waveguide and planar transmission line technologies including the microstrip.
  This study explores the current advancements and new opportunities in SIW implementation
  of RF and microwave devices including filters, multiplexers (diplexers and triplexers),
  power dividers/combiners, antennas, and sensors for modern communication systems.
