abstract: Polarization mode dispersion measurement using a Sagnac interferometer is
  compared with the well-known fixed analyzer technique both theoretically and experimentally.
  It is shown that in the case of weak mode coupling in the fiber the Sagnac interferometer
  method is equivalent to the fixed analyzer method but gives better readability of
  the measured optical spectrum. For strong mode coupling, we develop a theory that
  relates the differential group delay to the number of mean-level crossings in the
  measured spectrum.
