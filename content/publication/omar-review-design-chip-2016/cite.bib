 abstract = {Band Pass Filter is a type of device or electronic circuitry that permits just particular frequencies to go through it yet dismisses or recognizes the undesirable or frequencies. The top use of band pass filters can be found in Radio Frequency (RF) applications where the frequency range is between 3 KHz--300GHz. There are many ways that can be used to design band pass filters for RF application. Analogue passive on chip band pass filter that using spiral inductors suffers from eddy current, ohmic losses and very risky to electromagnetic interference. The spiral inductors still not manage to achieve a high Q factor which is very important in band pass filter. Active on chip band pass filter offer several techniques that can be used to design band pass filter which can compensate the weaknesses of passive on chip band pass filter. In this paper, design technique and performance of active on chip band pass filters using of Transconductance Capacitance (Gm-C) and active inductors will be reviewed.},
