abstract: Band Pass Filter is a type of device or electronic circuitry that permits
  just particular frequencies to go through it yet dismisses or recognizes the undesirable
  or frequencies. The top use of band pass filters can be found in Radio Frequency
  (RF) applications where the frequency range is between 3 KHz--300GHz. There are
  many ways that can be used to design band pass filters for RF application. Analogue
  passive on chip band pass filter that using spiral inductors suffers from eddy current,
  ohmic losses and very risky to electromagnetic interference. The spiral inductors
  still not manage to achieve a high Q factor which is very important in band pass
  filter. Active on chip band pass filter offer several techniques that can be used
  to design band pass filter which can compensate the weaknesses of passive on chip
  band pass filter. In this paper, design technique and performance of active on chip
  band pass filters using of Transconductance Capacitance (Gm-C) and active inductors
  will be reviewed.
