abstract: Making silicon shine bright Silicon is the workhorse of the semiconductor
  electronics industry, but its lack of optical functionality is a barrier to developing
  a truly integrated silicon-based optoelectronics platform. Although there are several
  ways of exploiting nonlinear light-matter interactions to coax silicon into optical
  functionality, the effects tend to be weak. Otterstrom et al. used a suspended silicon
  waveguide racetrack structure to stimulate the stronger nonlinear effect of Brillouin
  scattering and achieve lasing from silicon. The ability to engineer the nonlinearity
  and tune the optical response through the design of the suspended cavity provides
  a powerful and flexible route for developing silicon-based optoelectronic circuits
  and devices. Science, this issue p. 1113 Brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful
  and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave oscillators,
  and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions
  are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress
  toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic
  waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most
  tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered
  nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that
  this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical
  self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform
  to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic
  circuits. Brillouin scattering is exploited to develop a silicon laser. Brillouin
  scattering is exploited to develop a silicon laser.
