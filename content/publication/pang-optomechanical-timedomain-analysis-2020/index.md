abstract: Guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering has gained considerable interest
  in recent years because of its capacity to detect mechanical features of materials
  surrounding the optical fiber. Nevertheless, distributed measurements using this
  mechanism are rarely taken because of the impracticality of the method's forward
  scattering mechanism. Recently, remarkable work using ingenious schemes has managed
  to address the difficulty, which opens a brand new way to achieve position-resolved
  substance identification. However, due to the long acoustic wave lifetime and insufficient
  signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), current spatial resolution is restricted to 15--50
  m, which is far from practical requirements. Here we propose a novel opto-mechanical
  time-domain analysis based on coherent forward stimulated Brillouin scattering probing
  to greatly improve the achievable spatial resolution. The coherent transverse acoustic
  wave is first created by a long activation pulse and then probed by a short two-tone
  probe pulse. The two-tone probing process involves a coherent stimulated interaction
  between the probe pulse and the excited transverse acoustic wave. The interaction,
  which we first propose here, shows a distinct phase-sensitive characteristic. This
  new coherent stimulated probing process, if it is well controlled, will enhance
  the forward stimulated Brillouin scattering intensity and thus improve the SNR of
  the sensing. Moreover, higher SNR backward stimulated Brillouin scattering is used
  to detect the intensity evolution of the probe pulse. Owing to this new sensing
  scheme combined with a more robust demodulation algorithm, we demonstrated a 2 m
  spatial resolution opto-mechanical measurement over a 225 m long fiber in which
  we were able to distinguish air from alcohol. These advances greatly facilitate
  the practicability of forward stimulated Brillouin scattering.
