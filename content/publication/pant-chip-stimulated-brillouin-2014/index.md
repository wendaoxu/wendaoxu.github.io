abstract: Demonstration of continuously tunable delay, low-noise lasers, dynamically
  controlled gratings, and optical phase shifting using the stimulated Brillouin scattering
  (SBS) process has lead to the emergence of SBS as a promising technology for microwave
  photonics. On-chip realization of SBS enables photonic integration of microwave
  photonic signal processing and offers significantly enhanced performance and improved
  efficiency. On-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering is reviewed in the context of
  slow-light based tunable delay, low-noise narrow linewidth lasers and filtering
  for integrated microwave photonics. A discussion on key material and device properties,
  necessary to enable on-chip Brillouin scattering using both the single-pass and
  resonator geometry, is presented along with an outlook for photonic integration
  of microwave signal processing and generation in other platforms. On-chip realization
