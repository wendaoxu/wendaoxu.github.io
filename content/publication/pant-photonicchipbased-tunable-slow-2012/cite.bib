 abstract = {We report the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of photonic chip based tunable slow and fast light via stimulated Brillouin scattering. Slow, fast, and negative group velocities were observed in a 7~cm long chalcogenide (As2S3) rib waveguide with a group index change ranging from $∼-$44 to +130, which results in a maximum delay of $∼$23\,ns at a relatively low gain of $∼$23\,dB. Demonstration of large tunable delays in a chip scale device opens up applications such as frequency sensing and true-time delay for a phased array antenna, where integration and delays $∼$10\,ns are highly desirable.},
