abstract: We report the first (to our knowledge) demonstration of photonic chip based
  tunable slow and fast light via stimulated Brillouin scattering. Slow, fast, and
  negative group velocities were observed in a 7~cm long chalcogenide (As2S3) rib
  waveguide with a group index change ranging from $∼-$44 to +130, which results in
  a maximum delay of $∼$23,ns at a relatively low gain of $∼$23,dB. Demonstration
  of large tunable delays in a chip scale device opens up applications such as frequency
  sensing and true-time delay for a phased array antenna, where integration and delays
  $∼$10,ns are highly desirable.
