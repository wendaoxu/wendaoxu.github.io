abstract: Monitoring cerebral blood flow (CBF) during neurosurgery can provide important
  physiological information for a variety of surgical procedures. CBF measurements
  are important for assessing whether blood flow has returned to presurgical baseline
  levels and for assessing postsurgical tissue viability. Existing techniques for
  intraoperative monitoring of CBF based on magnetic resonance imaging are expensive
  and often impractical, while techniques such as indocyanine green angiography cannot
  produce quantitative measures of blood flow. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)
  is an optical technique that has been widely used to quantitatively image relative
  CBF in animal models in vivo. In a pilot clinical study, we adapted an existing
  neurosurgical operating microscope to obtain LSCI images in humans in real time
  during neurosurgery under baseline conditions and after bipolar cautery. Simultaneously
  recorded ECG waveforms from the patient were used to develop a filter that helped
  reduce measurement variabilities due to motion artifacts. Results from this study
  demonstrate the feasibility of using LSCI to obtain blood flow images during neurosurgeries
  and its capability to produce full field CBF image maps with excellent spatial resolution
  in real-time with minimal disruption to the surgical procedure.
