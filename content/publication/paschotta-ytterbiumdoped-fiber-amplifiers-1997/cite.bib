 abstract = {The ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier offers a number of attractive features, including a broad-gain bandwidth and a high efficiency, due in large part to its freedom from various competing processes seen in other rare-earth dopants. Here we discuss the main features that influence design and possible applications of ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers.},
