abstract: The ytterbium-doped fiber amplifier offers a number of attractive features,
  including a broad-gain bandwidth and a high efficiency, due in large part to its
  freedom from various competing processes seen in other rare-earth dopants. Here
  we discuss the main features that influence design and possible applications of
  ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers.
