abstract: We demonstrate by numerical simulation that the general features of the
  loss spectrum of photonic crystal fibres (PCF) with a kagome structure can be explained
  by simple models consisting of thin concentric hexagons or rings of glass in air.
  These easily analysed models provide increased understanding of the mechanism of
  guidance in kagome PCF, and suggest ways in which the high-loss resonances in the
  loss spectrum may be shifted.
