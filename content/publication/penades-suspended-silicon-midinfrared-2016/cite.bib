 abstract = {We present several fundamental photonic building blocks based on suspended silicon waveguides supported by a lateral cladding comprising subwavelength grating metamaterial. We discuss the design, fabrication, and characterization of waveguide bends, multimode interference devices and Mach-Zehnder interferometers for the 3715 - 3800 nm wavelength range, demonstrated for the first time in this platform. The waveguide propagation loss of 0.82 dB/cm is reported, some of the lowest loss yet achieved in silicon waveguides for this wavelength range. These results establish a direct path to ultimately extending the operational wavelength range of silicon wire waveguides to the entire transparency window of silicon.},
