abstract: We present several fundamental photonic building blocks based on suspended
  silicon waveguides supported by a lateral cladding comprising subwavelength grating
  metamaterial. We discuss the design, fabrication, and characterization of waveguide
  bends, multimode interference devices and Mach-Zehnder interferometers for the 3715
  - 3800 nm wavelength range, demonstrated for the first time in this platform. The
  waveguide propagation loss of 0.82 dB/cm is reported, some of the lowest loss yet
  achieved in silicon waveguides for this wavelength range. These results establish
  a direct path to ultimately extending the operational wavelength range of silicon
  wire waveguides to the entire transparency window of silicon.
