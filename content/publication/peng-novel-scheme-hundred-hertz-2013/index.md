abstract: We propose a novel scheme to accurately determine the hundred-hertz linewidth
  using the delayed self-heterodyne method, in which the delay time is far less than
  the coherence time of the laser. This exceeds the former understanding of the delayed
  self-heterodyne technique, which requires a prohibitively long fiber. The self-heterodyne
  autocorrelation function and power spectrum are evaluated, and by numerical analysis
  we ensure that -3 dB of the power spectrum is applied to the self-heterodyne linewidth
  measurements. For a laser linewidth of less than 100Hz, the linewidth can be measured
  directly by a 10 km fiber, and in a more general case, the linewidth can be deduced
  from -20 dB or -40 dB of the fitting Lorentzian curve.
