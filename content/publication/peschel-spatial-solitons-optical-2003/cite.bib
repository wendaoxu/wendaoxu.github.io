 abstract = {We discuss the existence and the stability properties of spatial solitons, which are excited in externally driven nonlinear resonators. First, we give a short derivation of the basic equations we use to describe the field dynamics in a Fabry-Perot cavity. Then we show how the range of existence of cavity solitons is related to the stability properties of respective continuous wave solutions. Theoretical predictions are illustrated by numerical results and experimental findings.},
