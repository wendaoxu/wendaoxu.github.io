abstract: We discuss the existence and the stability properties of spatial solitons,
  which are excited in externally driven nonlinear resonators. First, we give a short
  derivation of the basic equations we use to describe the field dynamics in a Fabry-Perot
  cavity. Then we show how the range of existence of cavity solitons is related to
  the stability properties of respective continuous wave solutions. Theoretical predictions
  are illustrated by numerical results and experimental findings.
