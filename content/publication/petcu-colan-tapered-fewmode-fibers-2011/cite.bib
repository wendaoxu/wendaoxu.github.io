 abstract = {In this paper, the evolution of the LP11 mode during the fabrication of tapered optical fibers is examined. General trends in the modal coupling are inferred from probe beam transmission plots. Alternative tapered fiber shapes are proposed for the creation of an efficient few-mode fiber for different wavelengths, and core and cladding radii.},
