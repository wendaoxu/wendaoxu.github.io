abstract: In this paper, the evolution of the LP11 mode during the fabrication of
  tapered optical fibers is examined. General trends in the modal coupling are inferred
  from probe beam transmission plots. Alternative tapered fiber shapes are proposed
  for the creation of an efficient few-mode fiber for different wavelengths, and core
  and cladding radii.
