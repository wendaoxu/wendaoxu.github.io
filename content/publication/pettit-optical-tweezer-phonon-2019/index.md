abstract: Phonon lasers are mechanical analogues of the ubiquitous optical laser and
  have been realized in a variety of contexts1--12. However, no such demonstration
  exists for mesoscopic levitated optomechanical systems, which are emerging as important
  platforms for conducting fundamental tests of quantum mechanics13--15 and gravity16,
  as well as for developing sensing modalities that couple mechanical motion to electron
  spin17--20 and charge21. Inspired by the pioneering work of Arthur Ashkin on optical
  tweezers22,23, we introduce a mesoscopic, frequency-tunable phonon laser based on
  the centre-of-mass oscillation of a silica nanosphere levitated in an optical tweezer
  under vacuum. Unlike previous levitated realizations, our scheme is general enough
  to be used on single electrons, liquid droplets or even small biological organisms24.
  Our device thus provides a pathway for a coherent source of phonons on the mesoscale
  that can be applied to both fundamental problems in quantum mechanics as well as
  tasks of precision metrology25--27.
