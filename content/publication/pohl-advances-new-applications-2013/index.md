abstract: This work presents a short review of the current research on the acousto-optic
  mechanism applied to optical fibers. The role of the piezoelectric element and the
  acousto-optic modulator in the excitation of flexural and longitudinal acoustic
  modes in the frequency range up to 1.2 MHz is highlighted. A combination of the
  finite elements and the transfer matrix methods is used to simulate the interaction
  of the waves with Bragg and long period gratings. Results show a very good agreement
  with experimental data. Recent applications such as the writing of gratings under
  the acoustic excitation and a novel viscometer sensor based on the acousto-optic
  mechanism are discussed.
