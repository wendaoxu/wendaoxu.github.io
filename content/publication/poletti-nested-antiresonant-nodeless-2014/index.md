abstract: We propose a novel hollow core fiber design based on nested and non-touching
  antiresonant tube elements arranged around a central core. We demonstrate through
  numerical simulations that such a design can achieve considerably lower loss than
  other state-of-the-art hollow fibers. By adding additional pairs of coherently reflecting
  surfaces without introducing nodes, the Hollow Core Nested Antiresonant Nodeless
  Fiber (HC-NANF) can achieve values of confinement loss similar or lower than that
  of its already low surface scattering loss, while maintaining multiple and octave-wide
  antiresonant windows of operation. As a result, the HC-NANF can in principle reach
  a total value of loss -- including leakage, surface scattering and bend contributions
  -- that is lower than that of conventional solid fibers. Besides, through resonant
  out-coupling of high order modes they can be made to behave as effectively single
  mode fibers.
