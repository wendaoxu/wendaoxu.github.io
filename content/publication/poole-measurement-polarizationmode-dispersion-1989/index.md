abstract: A simple frequency-domain technique for measuring polarization-mode dispersion
  in single-mode fibers with random mode coupling is used to give what is to my knowledge
  the first direct experimental demonstration of the transition of the dispersion
  from a linear length dependence to a square-root-of-length dependence. Sensitivity
  to external perturbations is demonstrated by an order-of-magnitude increase in dispersion
  when the fiber is removed from a conventional spool and placed on a large-diameter
  drum. An expression for the length-dependent probability density function that describes
  the dispersion for highly coherent sources is also presented and confirmed experimentally.
