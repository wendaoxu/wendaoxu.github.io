 abstract = {Abstract: We show a method for distortion-free quasi storage of light which is based on the coherence between the spectrum and the time representation of pulse sequences. The whole system can be considered as a black box that stores the light until it will be extracted. In the experiment we delayed several 5 bit patterns with bit durations of 500ps up to 38ns. The delay can be tuned in fine and coarse range. The method works in the entire transparency range of optical fibers and only uses standard components of optical telecommunications. Hence, it can easily be integrated into existing systems.},
