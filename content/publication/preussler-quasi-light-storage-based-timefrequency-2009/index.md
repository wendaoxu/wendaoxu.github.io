abstract: 'Abstract: We show a method for distortion-free quasi storage of light which
  is based on the coherence between the spectrum and the time representation of pulse
  sequences. The whole system can be considered as a black box that stores the light
  until it will be extracted. In the experiment we delayed several 5 bit patterns
  with bit durations of 500ps up to 38ns. The delay can be tuned in fine and coarse
  range. The method works in the entire transparency range of optical fibers and only
  uses standard components of optical telecommunications. Hence, it can easily be
  integrated into existing systems.'
