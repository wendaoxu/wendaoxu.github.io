abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is one of the most dominant nonlinear
  effects in standard single-mode fibers and its unique spectral characteristics,
  especially the narrow bandwidth, enable many different applications. Most of the
  applications would benefit from a narrower bandwidth. Different methods for the
  bandwidth reduction of SBS in optical fibers are presented and discussed. A bandwidth
  reduction down to 17% of the natural gain can be achieved by the superposition of
  the gain with two losses or the utilization of a multistage system. Furthermore,
  applications in the field of microwave photonics and optical signal processing like
  high-resolution spectroscopy of communication signals, the storage of optical data
  packets as well as the processing of frequency combs including generation of millimeter
  waves and ideal sinc-shaped Nyquist pulses are presented.
