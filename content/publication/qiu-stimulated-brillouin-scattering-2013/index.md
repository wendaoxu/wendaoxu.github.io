abstract: We develop a general framework of evaluating the Stimulated Brillouin Scattering
  (SBS) gain coefficient in optical waveguides via the overlap integral between optical
  and elastic eigen-modes. This full-vectorial formulation of SBS coupling rigorously
  accounts for the effects of both radiation pressure and electrostriction within
  micro- and nano-scale waveguides. We show that both contributions play a critical
  role in SBS coupling as modal confinement approaches the sub-wavelength scale. Through
  analysis of each contribution to the optical force, we show that spatial symmetry
  of the optical force dictates the selection rules of the excitable elastic modes.
  By applying this method to a rectangular silicon waveguide, we demonstrate how the
  optical force distribution and elastic modal profiles jointly determine the magnitude
  and scaling of SBS gains in both forward and backward SBS processes. We further
  apply this method to the study of intra- and inter-modal SBS processes, and demonstrate
  that the coupling between distinct optical modes are necessary to excite elastic
  modes with all possible symmetries. For example, we show that strong inter-polarization
  coupling can be achieved between the fundamental TE- and TM-like modes of a suspended
  silicon waveguide.
