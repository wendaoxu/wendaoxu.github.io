abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is traditionally viewed as a process
  whose strength is dictated by intrinsic material nonlinearities with little dependence
  on waveguide geometry. We show that this paradigm breaks down at the nanoscale,
  as tremendous radiation pressures produce new forms of SBS nonlinearities. A coherent
  combination of radiation pressure and electrostrictive forces is seen to enhance
  both forward and backward SBS processes by orders of magnitude, creating new geometric
  degrees of freedom through which photon-phonon coupling becomes highly tailorable.
  At nanoscales, the backward-SBS gain is seen to be 104 times greater than in conventional
  silica fibers with 100 times greater values than predicted by conventional SBS treatments.
  Furthermore, radically enhanced forward-SBS processes are 105 times larger than
  any known waveguide system. In addition, when nanoscale silicon waveguides are cooled
  to low temperatures, a further 10--100 times increase in SBS gain is seen as phonon
  losses are reduced. As a result, a 100-$Î¼$m segment of the waveguide has equivalent
  nonlinearity to a kilometer of fiber. Couplings of this magnitude would enable efficient
  chip-scale stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon waveguides for the first time.
  More generally, we develop a new full-vectorial theoretical formulation of stimulated
  Brillouin scattering that accurately incorporates the effects of boundary-induced
  nonlinearities and radiation pressure, both of which are seen to have tremendous
  impact on photon-phonon coupling at subwavelength scales. This formalism, which
  treats both intermode and intramode coupling within periodic and translationally
  invariant waveguide systems, reveals a rich landscape of new stimulated Brillouin
  processes when applied to nanoscale systems.
