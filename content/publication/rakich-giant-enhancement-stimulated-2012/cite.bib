 abstract = {We show that the nature of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) radically changes at nanoscales due to tremendous internal radiation pressures. Coherent interplay between radiation pressure and electrostriction yields giant enhancement of SBS and tailorable photon-phonon coupling. o̧pyright 2009 Optical Society of America.},
