abstract: We show that the nature of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) radically
  changes at nanoscales due to tremendous internal radiation pressures. Coherent interplay
  between radiation pressure and electrostriction yields giant enhancement of SBS
  and tailorable photon-phonon coupling. oÌ§pyright 2009 Optical Society of America.
