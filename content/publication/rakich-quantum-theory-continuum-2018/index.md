abstract: We present the basic ingredients of continuum optomechanics, i.e. the suitable
  extension of cavity-optomechanical concepts to the interaction of photons and phonons
  in an extended waveguide. We introduce a real-space picture and argue which coupling
  terms may arise in leading order in the spatial derivatives. This picture allows
  us to discuss quantum noise, dissipation, and the correct boundary conditions at
  the waveguide entrance. The connections both to optomechanical arrays as well as
  to the theory of Brillouin scattering in waveguides are highlighted. Among other
  examples, we analyze the `strong coupling regime' of continuum optomechanics that
  may be accessible in future experiments.
