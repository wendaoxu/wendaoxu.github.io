abstract: Radiation pressure is known to scale to large values in engineered micro
  and nanoscale photonic waveguide systems. In addition to radiation pressure, dielectric
  materials also exhibit strain-dependent refractive index changes, through which
  optical fields can induce electrostrictive forces. To date, little attention has
  been paid to the electrostrictive component of optical forces in high-index contrast
  waveguides. In this paper, we examine the magnitude, scaling, and spatial distribution
  of electrostrictive forces through analytical and numerical models, revealing that
  electrostrictive forces increase to large values in high index-contrast waveguides.
  Similar to radiation pressure, electrostrictive forces increase quadratically with
  the optical field. However, since electrostrictive forces are determined by the
  material photoelastic tensor, the sign of the electrostrictive force is highly material-dependent,
  resulting in cancellation with radiation pressure in some instances. Furthermore,
  our analysis reveals that the optical forces resulting from both radiation pressure
  and electrostriction can scale to remarkably high levels (i.e., greater than 104(N/m2))
  for realistic guided powers. Additionally, even in simple rectangular waveguides,
  the magnitude and distribution of both forces can be engineered at the various boundaries
  of the waveguide system by choice of material system and geometry of the waveguide.This
  tailorability points towards novel and simple waveguide designs which enable selective
  excitation of elastic waves with desired symmetries through engineered stimulated
  Brillouin scattering processes in nanoscale waveguide systems.
