 abstract = {Scanning the wavelength in high-birefringence fibers inherently measures the group delay difference, and not the phase delay difference, between the two polarization modes. Dispersion of the birefringence will result in a 10--20% error in fiber beat lengths interpolated from such measurements, even if only stress birefringence is present. Geometrical dispersion can introduce even larger errors in some fibers.},
