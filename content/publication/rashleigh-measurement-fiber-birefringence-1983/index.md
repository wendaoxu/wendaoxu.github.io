abstract: Scanning the wavelength in high-birefringence fibers inherently measures
  the group delay difference, and not the phase delay difference, between the two
  polarization modes. Dispersion of the birefringence will result in a 10--20% error
  in fiber beat lengths interpolated from such measurements, even if only stress birefringence
  is present. Geometrical dispersion can introduce even larger errors in some fibers.
