 abstract = {The polarization state of light in single-mode fibers is very sensitive to any perturbation which is not symmetric about the fiber axis. While this is a source of noise, drift, or signal fading in some applications, it can also be exploited in novel guided-wave devices. The basic birefringences that couple the two modes and change the polarization state along the fiber are reviewed. The three cases of uniform, phase-matched, and random coupling are considered. Polarization preservation in both low- and high-birefringence fibers is achieved by reducing this coupling. In addition to polarization-state changes, bireftingent fibers can quickly reduce the polarization degree of nonmonochromatic light if both modes are excited, a characteristic that greatly simplifies evaluation of the degree of polarization preservation in these fibers. Current evaluations of the birefringence and the polarization-holding ability of state-of-the-art fibers are discussed, and it is concluded that fibers with good polarization-holding properties are becoming available.},
