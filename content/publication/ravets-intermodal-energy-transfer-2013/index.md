abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the energy transfer
  between modes during the tapering process of an optical nanofiber through spectrogram
  analysis. The results allow optimization of the tapering process, and we measure
  transmission in excess of 99.95% for the fundamental mode. We quantify the adiabaticity
  condition through calculations and place an upper bound on the amount of energy
  transferred to other modes at each step of the tapering, giving practical limits
  to the tapering angle.
