abstract: Optical nanofibers confine light to subwavelength scales, and are of interest
  for the design, integration, and interconnection of nanophotonic devices. Here we
  demonstrate high transmission (&gt; 97%) of the first family of excited modes through
  a 350 nm radius fiber, by appropriate choice of the fiber and precise control of
  the taper geometry. We can design the nanofibers so that these modes propagate with
  most of their energy outside the waist region. We also present an optical setup
  for selectively launching these modes with less than 1% fundamental mode contamination.
  Our experimental results are in good agreement with simulations of the propagation.
  Multimode optical nanofibers expand the photonic toolbox, and may aid in the realization
  of a fully integrated nanoscale device for communication science, laser science
  or other sensing applications.
