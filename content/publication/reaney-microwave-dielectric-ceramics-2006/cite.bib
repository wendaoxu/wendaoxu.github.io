 abstract = {Temperature-stable, medium-permittivity dielectric ceramics have been used as resonators in filters for microwave (MW) communications for several decades. The growth of the mobile phone market in the 1990s led to extensive research and development in this area. The main driving forces were the greater utilization of available bandwidth, that necessitates extremely low dielectric loss (high-quality factor), an increase in permittivity so that smaller components could be fabricated, and, as ever in the commercial world, cost reduction. Over the last decade, a clear picture has emerged of the principal factors, that influence MW properties. This article reviews these basic principles and gives examples of where they have been used to control microwave properties and ultimately develop new materials.},
