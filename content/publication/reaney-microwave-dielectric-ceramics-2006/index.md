abstract: Temperature-stable, medium-permittivity dielectric ceramics have been used
  as resonators in filters for microwave (MW) communications for several decades.
  The growth of the mobile phone market in the 1990s led to extensive research and
  development in this area. The main driving forces were the greater utilization of
  available bandwidth, that necessitates extremely low dielectric loss (high-quality
  factor), an increase in permittivity so that smaller components could be fabricated,
  and, as ever in the commercial world, cost reduction. Over the last decade, a clear
  picture has emerged of the principal factors, that influence MW properties. This
  article reviews these basic principles and gives examples of where they have been
  used to control microwave properties and ultimately develop new materials.
