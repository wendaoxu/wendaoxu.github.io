abstract: 'Recent developments in micromachining techniques at the University of Michigan
  have resulted in novel high-performance low-loss filters for microwave and millimeter-wave
  applications. The idea is based on suspending the filters on thin dielectric membranes
  to eliminate dielectric loss and dispersion problems, resulting in a pure TEM mode
  of propagation and conductor-loss-limited performance. The dielectric membrane and
  the surrounding cavities are built using chemical etching in Silicon and GaAs wafers.
  The filters are therefore compatible with low-cost IC fabrication techniques and
  can be combined with planar diodes and transistors to result in active filter networks.
  Several state-of-the-art filters have been realized including 15-GHz and 20-GHz
  bandpass interdigital suspended stripline filters, lowpass and bandpass microshield
  filters at 30 GHz and 90 GHz, microstrip 94-GHz bandpass filters, and a 250-GHz
  bandpass filter with 1.0--1.5-dB insertion loss. This article reviews the associated
  fabrication techniques, the different types of transmission lines achieved using
  this technology, and the measured performance from 15 to 350 GHz. The study concludes
  with a detailed description of the future work in this area. oÌ§pyright 1997 John
