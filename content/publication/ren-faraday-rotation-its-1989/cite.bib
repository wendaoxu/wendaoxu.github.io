 abstract = {A setup allowing a rapid and efficient determination of Faraday rotation in low-birefringence fibers in the absence of linear birefringence is presented. Practical results, i.e. the Verdet constant and its variation with temperature between 25 degrees C and 140 degrees C, are given for three specimens of commercial low-birefringence fiber at a wavelength of 633 nm and in a DC magnetic field. The measurement technique is shown to offer a rapid and efficient determination of the Verdet constant in the absence of linear birefringence.$<>$},
