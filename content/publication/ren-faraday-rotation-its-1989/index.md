abstract: A setup allowing a rapid and efficient determination of Faraday rotation
  in low-birefringence fibers in the absence of linear birefringence is presented.
  Practical results, i.e. the Verdet constant and its variation with temperature between
  25 degrees C and 140 degrees C, are given for three specimens of commercial low-birefringence
  fiber at a wavelength of 633 nm and in a DC magnetic field. The measurement technique
  is shown to offer a rapid and efficient determination of the Verdet constant in
  the absence of linear birefringence.$<>$
