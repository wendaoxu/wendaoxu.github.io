abstract: We quantify the strength of stimulated forward Brillouin scattering in hollow-core
  photonic bandgap fiber through a combination of experiments and multi-physics simulations.
  Brillouin spectroscopy methods reveal a family of densely spaced Brillouin-active
  phonon modes below 100 MHz with coupling strengths that approach those of conventional
  silica fiber. The experimental results are corroborated by multi-physics simulations,
  revealing that relatively strong optomechanical coupling is mediated by a combination
  of electrostriction and radiation pressure within the nano-scale silica-air matrix;
  the nontrivial mechanical properties of this silica-air matrix facilitate the large
  optomechanical response produced by this system. Simulations also reveal an incredible
  sensitivity of the Brillouin spectrum to fiber critical dimensions, suggesting opportunity
  for enhancement or suppression of these interactions. Finally, we relate the measured
  and calculated couplings to the noise properties of the fiber as the foundation
  for phase- and polarization-noise estimates in hollow-core fiber. More generally,
  such Brillouin interactions are an important consideration in both the high and
  low optical intensity limits.
