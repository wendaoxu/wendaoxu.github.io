abstract: Photonic-bandgap fibers have had major impact from fundamental studies of
  photon--atom interactions to new applications in nonlinear optics. While much is
  known about the optical properties of these fibers, relatively little is known about
  their optomechanical properties. Here we identify a new form of optomechanical coupling
  in gas-filled hollow-core fibers. We show that forward Brillouin scattering is produced
  by air in the core of a photonic bandgap fiber. A single Brillouin resonance is
  identified at 35 MHz, which corresponds to a guided sound wave within the center
  of an air-filled hollow-core fiber. A simple analytical model, refined by numerical
  simulations, is developed that accurately predicts the Brillouin coupling strength
  and frequency from the gas and fiber parameters, revealing that this optomechanical
  interaction is highly tailorable. This new mechanism could become the basis for
  new types of sensing and spectroscopy. Moreover, this previously unknown nonlinearity
  within hollow core fibers represents a power and noise limitation that requires
  further consideration.
