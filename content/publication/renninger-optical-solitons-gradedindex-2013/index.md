abstract: Solitons are non-dispersing localized waves that occur in diverse physical
  settings, including liquids, optical fibres, plasmas and condensed matter. They
  attract interest owing to their particle-like nature and are useful for applications
  such as in telecommunications. A variety of optical solitons have been observed,
  but versions that involve both spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are rare.
  Optical fibres designed to support multiple transverse modes offer opportunities
  to study wave propagation in a setting that is intermediate between single-mode
  fibre and free-space propagation. Here we report the observation of optical solitons
  and soliton self-frequency shifting in graded-index multimode fibre. These wave
  packets can be modelled as multicomponent solitons, or as solitons of the Gross--Pitaevskii
  equation. Solitons in graded-index fibres should enable increased data rates in
  low-cost telecommunications systems, are pertinent to space-division multiplexing,
  and can offer a new route to mode-area scaling for high-power lasers and transmission.
