abstract: Parabolic amplifier similaritons are observed inside a normal-dispersion
  laser. The self-similar pulse is a local nonlinear attractor in the gain segment
  of the oscillator. The evolution in the laser exhibits large (20 times) spectral
  breathing, and the pulse chirp is less than the group-velocity dispersion of the
  cavity. All of these features are consistent with numerical simulations. The amplifier
  similariton evolution also yields practical features such as parabolic output pulses
  with high energies, and the shortest pulses to date from a normal-dispersion laser.
