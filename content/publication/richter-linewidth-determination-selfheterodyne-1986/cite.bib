 abstract = {The behavior of the power spectrum of an external cavity semiconductor laser has been studied using a delayed self-heterodyne interferometric technique that uses delay times less than the laser's coherence time. Experimental results show that the resulting power spectrum is consistent with the theoretical model. However, there is evidence that additional frequency fluctuations are present that cause the delta function portion of the power spectrum to have a finite width.},
