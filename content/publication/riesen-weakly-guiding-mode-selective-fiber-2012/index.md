abstract: This paper presents analytical descriptions of the behavior of weakly-guiding/weakly-coupled
  mode-selective fiber couplers, based on coupled-mode theory. Mode-selective couplers
  rely on the phase-matching of a higher-order mode in one fiber with the fundamental
  mode of a second, closely-positioned fiber. Their behavior is shown to be highly-dependent
  on the principle and azimuthal mode numbers of the higher-order mode, as well as
  its spatial-orientation. Zero coupling is shown to be possible for an asymmetric
  higher-order mode even when there is perfect phase-matching. The theory is also
  numerically simulated, and could assist in the future design of efficient mode-selective
  couplers for a wide range of optical communications and sensor systems.
