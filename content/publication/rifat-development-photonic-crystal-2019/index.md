abstract: The development of highly-sensitive and miniaturized sensors that capable
  of realtime analytes detection is highly desirable. Nowadays, toxic or colorless
  gas detection, air pollution monitoring, harmful chemical, pressure, strain, humidity,
  and temperature sensors based on photonic crystal fiber (PCF) are increasing rapidly
  due to its compact structure, fast response and efficient light controlling capabilities.
  The propagating light through the PCF can be controlled by varying the structural
  parameters and core-cladding materials, as a result, evanescent field can be enhanced
  significantly which is the main component of the PCF based gas/chemical sensors.
  The aim of this chapter is to (1) describe the principle operation of PCF based
  gas/ chemical sensors, (2) discuss the important PCF properties for optical sensors,
  (3) extensively discuss the different types of microstructured optical fiber based
  gas/ chemical sensors, (4) study the effects of different core-cladding shapes,
  and fiber background materials on sensing performance, and (5) highlight the main
  challenges of PCF based gas/ chemical sensors and possible solutions.
