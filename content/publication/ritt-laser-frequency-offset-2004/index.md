abstract: We report on the demonstration of a novel scheme for laser frequency offset
  locking. Following standard techniques, a beat signal is generated between the laser
  to be frequency stabilized and a second laser with known frequency. A frequency
  dependent error signal is derived from this beat note by using the amplitude response
  of an electronic high pass filter. The steep slope of the error signal near the
  zero-crossing allows for precise frequency locking by a servo loop, while simultaneously
  a broad capture range of several hundreds of MHz is obtained.
