abstract: We describe a simple method for measuring ultralow birefringence in optical
  fibers. It allows one to measure birefringence in the range of 4×10-6--1.25×10-8,
  which corresponds to the 0.25--80-m range of the polarization beat length at the
  wavelength of 1,textmum. A fiber section of a length shorter than the polarization
  beat length can be used for measurement. The measuring procedure involves measurement
  of the light intensity only and does not require an analysis of the light-polarization
  state. Experimental results for an optical fiber with a beat length of 1.9,m are
  presented.
