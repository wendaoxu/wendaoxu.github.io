abstract: Today, acoustic filters are the filter technology to meet the requirements
  with respect to performance dictated by the cellular phone standards and their form
  factor. Around two billion cellular phones are sold every year, and smart phones
  are of a very high percentage of approximately two-thirds. Smart phones require
  a very high number of filter functions ranging from the low double-digit range up
  to almost triple digit numbers in the near future. In the frequency range up to
  1 GHz, surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters are almost exclusively employed, while
  in the higher frequency range, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and SAW filters are competing
  for their shares. Prerequisites for the success of acoustic filters were the availability
  of high-quality substrates, advanced and highly reproducible fabrication technologies,
  optimum filter techniques, precise simulation software, and advanced design tools
  that allow the fast and efficient design according to customer specifications. This
  paper will try to focus on innovations leading to high volume applications of intermediate
  frequency (IF) and radio frequency (RF) acoustic filters, e.g., TV IF filters, IF
  filters for cellular phones, and SAW/BAW RF filters for the RF front-end of cellular
  phones.
