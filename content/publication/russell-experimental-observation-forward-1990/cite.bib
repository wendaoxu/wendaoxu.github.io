 abstract = {Observation of intermodal forward stimulated Brillouin scattering at 514.5 nm in dual-mode optical fibres is reported. The FSBS signal is shifted by 16.6 MHz and, unlike in normal background SBS, does not depend significantly on the laser linewidth. The Brillouin gain in backward and forward directions is compared.$<<$ETX$>>$},
