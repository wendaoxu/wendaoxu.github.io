 abstract = {Unlike the capillaries conventionally used for gas-based spectral broadening of ultrashort ($<$100 fs) multi-millijoule pulses, which produce only normal dispersion at usable pressure levels, hollow-core photonic crystal fibres provide pressure-adjustable normal or anomalous dispersion. They also permit low-loss guidance in a hollow channel that is about ten times narrower and has a 100-fold-higher effective nonlinearity than capillary-based systems. This has led to several dramatic results, including soliton compression to few-cycle pulses, widely tunable deep-ultraviolet light sources, novel soliton--plasma interactions and multi-octave Raman frequency combs. A new generation of versatile and efficient gas-based light sources, which are tunable from the vacuum ultraviolet to the near infrared, and of versatile and efficient pulse compression devices is emerging.},
