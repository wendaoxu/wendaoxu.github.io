abstract: Unlike the capillaries conventionally used for gas-based spectral broadening
  of ultrashort ($<$100 fs) multi-millijoule pulses, which produce only normal dispersion
  at usable pressure levels, hollow-core photonic crystal fibres provide pressure-adjustable
  normal or anomalous dispersion. They also permit low-loss guidance in a hollow channel
  that is about ten times narrower and has a 100-fold-higher effective nonlinearity
  than capillary-based systems. This has led to several dramatic results, including
  soliton compression to few-cycle pulses, widely tunable deep-ultraviolet light sources,
  novel soliton--plasma interactions and multi-octave Raman frequency combs. A new
  generation of versatile and efficient gas-based light sources, which are tunable
  from the vacuum ultraviolet to the near infrared, and of versatile and efficient
  pulse compression devices is emerging.
