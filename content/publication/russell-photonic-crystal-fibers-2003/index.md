abstract: Photonic crystal fibers guide light by corralling it within a periodic array
  of microscopic air holes that run along the entire fiber length. Largely through
  their ability to overcome the limitations of conventional fiber optics---for example,
  by permitting low-loss guidance of light in a hollow core---these fibers are proving
  to have a multitude of important technological and scientific applications spanning
  many disciplines. The result has been a renaissance of interest in optical fibers
  and their uses.
