 abstract = {We study the localisation and control of high frequency sound in a dual-core square-lattice photonic crystal fibre preform. The coupled states of two neighboring acoustic resonances are probed using an interferometric set up, and experimental evidence is obtained for odd and even symmetry trapped states. Full numerical solutions of the acoustic wave equation show the existence of a two-dimensional sonic band gap, and numerical modelling of the strain field at the defects gives results that agree well with the experimental observations. The results suggest that sonic band gaps can be used to manipulate sound with great precision and enhance its interaction with light.},
