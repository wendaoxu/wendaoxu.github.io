abstract: We study the localisation and control of high frequency sound in a dual-core
  square-lattice photonic crystal fibre preform. The coupled states of two neighboring
  acoustic resonances are probed using an interferometric set up, and experimental
  evidence is obtained for odd and even symmetry trapped states. Full numerical solutions
  of the acoustic wave equation show the existence of a two-dimensional sonic band
  gap, and numerical modelling of the strain field at the defects gives results that
  agree well with the experimental observations. The results suggest that sonic band
  gaps can be used to manipulate sound with great precision and enhance its interaction
  with light.
