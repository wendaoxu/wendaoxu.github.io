abstract: Recently, stimulated Brillouin scattering in a forward direction (FSBS)
  in a dual-mode single-core optical fiber was reported by the authors (see Electron
  Lett., vol.26 p.1195-6, 1990). Frequency shifts on the order of 17 MHz were seen
  in fiber supporting LP/sub 01/ and LP/sub 11/ modes at 514.5 nm. The phenomenon
  is examined in detail, and the governing differential equations of the three-wave
  parametric process, (involving laser pump, Brillouin signal, and acoustic flexural-wave
  phonon) are derived and solved. FSBS is possible because although the overlap integral
  between a flexural fiber mode and the light is small, the phonon lifetime is much
  longer than in conventional stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). FSBS may also
  be the first example of a nonlinear effect which is enhanced by increasing the optical
  model area at constant pump power.$<<$ETX$>>$
