abstract: Frequency modulated semiconductor laser signals are demodulated by optical
  heterodyne detection using an independently temperature stabilized semiconductor
  laser local oscillator and a square-law detector followed by electrical frequency
  discrimination circuitry. Short-term and long-term beat frequency stability of the
  free-running laser transmitter and the local oscillator are delineated. Direct frequency
  modulation characteristics of the laser transmitter are studied by observing the
  intermediate frequency spectra. Frequency modulation-demodulation of pulse pattern
  signals at 100-200 Mbit/s is demonstrated. Reduction of the intermediate frequency
  fluctuation to less than 5 MHz is realized by employing a feedback of the RF frequency
  discriminator output to the local oscillator injection current.
