 abstract = {Frequency modulated semiconductor laser signals are demodulated by optical heterodyne detection using an independently temperature stabilised semiconductor laser local oscillator and a square law detector followed by electrical frequency discrimination circuitry. Beat frequency stability of the free-running semiconductor laser transmitter and local oscillator and characteristics of direct frequency modulation and optical heterodyne detection are delineated.},
