abstract: Frequency modulated semiconductor laser signals are demodulated by optical
  heterodyne detection using an independently temperature stabilised semiconductor
  laser local oscillator and a square law detector followed by electrical frequency
  discrimination circuitry. Beat frequency stability of the free-running semiconductor
  laser transmitter and local oscillator and characteristics of direct frequency modulation
  and optical heterodyne detection are delineated.
