abstract: In this paper, we present a new filter architecture to enhance the out-of-band
  rejection of SBS-based passband filters with the microwave signal amplitude modulated.
  The new architecture is based on SBS and balanced detection (between the SBS-filtered
  signal and the original signal). The out-of-band rejection is compared to conventional
  SBS-based photonic microwave filters relying on amplitude and phase modulation,
  reaching an improvement of 17 dB compared to amplitude modulation.
