 abstract = {Transverse acoustic mode resonances enable a high accuracy determination of Poisson's ratio and elastic properties of optical fibers. An all-optical pump and probe technique is used for efficient excitation and accurate characterization of both, radial and torsional-radial acoustic resonances of optical fibers. Simple and precise algebraic expressions for the frequencies of high order acoustic resonances are derived, enabling a rigorous analysis of the experimental data using standard least squares fitting. Following this approach, the determination of Poisson's ratio does not require the measurement of any physical length, but only frequency measurements are required. An accuracy better than 1 ‰ is achieved. The dependence of the fiber Poisson's ratio with temperature is also determined experimentally.},
