abstract: Transverse acoustic mode resonances enable a high accuracy determination
  of Poisson's ratio and elastic properties of optical fibers. An all-optical pump
  and probe technique is used for efficient excitation and accurate characterization
  of both, radial and torsional-radial acoustic resonances of optical fibers. Simple
  and precise algebraic expressions for the frequencies of high order acoustic resonances
  are derived, enabling a rigorous analysis of the experimental data using standard
  least squares fitting. Following this approach, the determination of Poisson's ratio
  does not require the measurement of any physical length, but only frequency measurements
  are required. An accuracy better than 1 ‰ is achieved. The dependence of the fiber
  Poisson's ratio with temperature is also determined experimentally.
