 abstract = {We demonstrate simultaneous generation of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and guided-acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) from electrostriction of optical waves in a 60cm As&#x000A0;2Se&#x000A0;3-PMMA microtaper waveguide. The GAWBS in the microtaper couples with SBS through a complex energy transfer between weak Stokes and Anti-Stokes (AS) continuous waves in the presence of a high power pulsed pump wave. This results in an amplification of Stokes wave at 7.4 GHz due to modulation of the optical fiber by GAWBS at 211 MHz generated by the pump in addition to a strong Stokes peak at 7.62 GHz and a secondary peak at 7.8 GHz that are contributed by SBS for a 2&#x003BC;m As&#x000A0;2Se&#x000A0;3 core radius. Such strong coupling of forward and backward Brillouin scattering due to large acoustic impedance between the core and cladding in such compact, highly nonlinear fibers plays a vital role in simultaneously sensing longitudinal and trasnverse strain within the core as well as its surroundings.},
