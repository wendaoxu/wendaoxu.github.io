abstract: We demonstrate simultaneous generation of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering
  (SBS) and guided-acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) from electrostriction
  of optical waves in a 60cm As&#x000A0;2Se&#x000A0;3-PMMA microtaper waveguide. The
  GAWBS in the microtaper couples with SBS through a complex energy transfer between
  weak Stokes and Anti-Stokes (AS) continuous waves in the presence of a high power
  pulsed pump wave. This results in an amplification of Stokes wave at 7.4 GHz due
  to modulation of the optical fiber by GAWBS at 211 MHz generated by the pump in
  addition to a strong Stokes peak at 7.62 GHz and a secondary peak at 7.8 GHz that
  are contributed by SBS for a 2&#x003BC;m As&#x000A0;2Se&#x000A0;3 core radius. Such
  strong coupling of forward and backward Brillouin scattering due to large acoustic
  impedance between the core and cladding in such compact, highly nonlinear fibers
  plays a vital role in simultaneously sensing longitudinal and trasnverse strain
  within the core as well as its surroundings.
