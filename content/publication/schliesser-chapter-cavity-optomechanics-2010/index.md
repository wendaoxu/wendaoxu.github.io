abstract: Parametric coupling of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom forms the
  basis of many ultra-sensitive measurements of both force and mechanical displacement.
  An optical cavity with a mechanically compliant boundary enhances the optomechanical
  interaction, which gives rise to qualitatively new behavior which can modify the
  dynamics of the mechanical motion. As early as 1967, in a pioneering work, V.~Braginsky
  analyzed theoretically the role of radiation pressure in the interferometric measurement
  process, but it has remained experimentally unexplored for many decades. Here, we
  use whispering-gallery mode optical microresonators to study these radiation pressure
  phenomena. Optical microresonators simultaneously host optical and mechanical modes,
  which are systematically analyzed and optimized to feature ultra-low mechanical
  dissipation, photon storage times exceeding the mechanical oscillation period (i.e.
  the ``resolved-sideband regime'') and large optomechanical coupling. In this manner,
  it is demonstrated for the first time that dynamical backaction can be employed
  to cool mechanical modes, i.e., to reduce their thermally excited random motion.
  Utilizing this novel technique together with cryogenic pre-cooling of the mechanical
  oscillator, the phonon occupation of mechanical radial-breathing modes could be
  reduced to textlanglentextrangle=63textpm20 excitation quanta. The corresponding
  displacement fluctuations are monitored interferometrically with a sensitivity at
  the level of 1$Â·$10-18m/Hz, which is below the standard quantum limit (SQL). This
  implies that the readout is already in principle sufficient to measure the quantum
  mechanical zero-point position fluctuations of the mechanical mode. Moreover, it
  is shown that optical measurement techniques employed here are operating in a near-ideal
  manner according to the principles of quantum measurement, displaying a backaction-imprecision
  product close to the quantum limit.
