abstract: Development of acoustic and optoacoustic on-chip technologies calls for
  new solutions to guiding, storing and interfacing acoustic and optical waves in
  integrated silicon-on-insulator systems. One of the biggest challenges in this field
  is to suppress the radiative dissipation of the propagating acoustic waves, while
  co-localizing the optical and acoustic fields in the same region of an integrated
  waveguide. Here we address this problem by introducing anti-resonant reflecting
  acoustic waveguides (ARRAWs)---mechanical analogues of the anti-resonant reflecting
  optical waveguides. We discuss the principles of anti-resonant guidance and establish
  guidelines for designing efficient ARRAWs. Finally, we demonstrate examples of the
  simplest silicon/silica ARRAW platforms that can simultaneously serve as near-IR
  optical waveguides, and support strong backward Brillouin scattering.
