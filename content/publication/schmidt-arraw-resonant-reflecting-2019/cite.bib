 abstract = {Development of acoustic and optoacoustic on-chip technologies calls for new solutions to guiding, storing and interfacing acoustic and optical waves in integrated silicon-on-insulator (SOI) systems. One of the biggest challenges in this field is to suppress the radiative dissipation of the propagating acoustic waves, while co-localizing the optical and acoustic fields in the same region of an integrated waveguide. Here we address this problem by introducing Anti-Resonant Reflecting Acoustic Waveguides (ARRAWs) --- mechanical analogues of the Anti-Resonant Reflecting Optical Waveguides (ARROWs). We discuss the principles of anti-resonant guidance and establish guidelines for designing efficient ARRAWs. Finally, we demonstrate examples of the simplest silicon/silica ARRAW platforms that can simultaneously serve as near-IR optical waveguides, and support strong backward Brillouin scattering.},
