abstract: Development of acoustic and optoacoustic on-chip technologies calls for
  new solutions to guiding, storing and interfacing acoustic and optical waves in
  integrated silicon-on-insulator (SOI) systems. One of the biggest challenges in
  this field is to suppress the radiative dissipation of the propagating acoustic
  waves, while co-localizing the optical and acoustic fields in the same region of
  an integrated waveguide. Here we address this problem by introducing Anti-Resonant
  Reflecting Acoustic Waveguides (ARRAWs) --- mechanical analogues of the Anti-Resonant
  Reflecting Optical Waveguides (ARROWs). We discuss the principles of anti-resonant
  guidance and establish guidelines for designing efficient ARRAWs. Finally, we demonstrate
  examples of the simplest silicon/silica ARRAW platforms that can simultaneously
  serve as near-IR optical waveguides, and support strong backward Brillouin scattering.
