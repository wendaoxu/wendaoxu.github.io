abstract: The optimization of PhC waveguides is a key issue for successfully designing
  PhC devices. Since this design task is computationally expensive, efficient methods
  are demanded. The available codes for computing photonic bands are also applied
  to PhC waveguides. They are reliable but not very efficient, which is even more
  pronounced for dispersive material. We present a method based on higher order finite
  elements with curved cells, which allows to solve for the band structure taking
  directly into account the dispersiveness of the materials. This is accomplished
  by reformulating the wave equations as a linear eigenproblem in the complex wave-vectors
  k. For this method, we demonstrate the high efficiency for the computation of guided
  PhC waveguide modes by a convergence analysis.
