abstract: Analytic and numerical investigations of a cavity containing a Kerr medium
  are reported. The mean field equation with plane-wave excitation and diffraction
  is assumed. Stable hexagons are dominant close to threshold for a self-focusing
  medium. Bistable switching frustrates pattern formation for a self-defocusing medium.
  Under appropriate parametric conditions that we identify, there is coexistence of
  a homogeneous stationary solution, of a hexagonal pattern solution and of a large
  (in principle infinite) number of localized structure solutions which connect the
  homogeneous and hexagonal state. Further above threshold, the hexagons show defects,
  and then break up with apparent turbulence. For Gaussian beam excitation, the different
  symmetry leads to polygon formation for narrow beams, but quasihexagonal structures
  appear for broader beams.
