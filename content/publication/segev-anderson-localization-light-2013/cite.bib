 abstract = {Over the past decade, the Anderson localization of light and a wide variety of associated phenomena have come to the forefront of research. Numerous investigations have been made into the underlying physics of how disorder affects transport in a crystalline lattice incorporating disorder. The physics involved relies on the analogy between the paraxial equation for electromagnetic waves and the Schrödinger equation describing quantum phenomena. Experiments have revealed how wavefunctions evolve during the localization process, and have led to discoveries of new physics that are universal to wave systems incorporating disorder. This Review summarizes the phenomena associated with the transverse localization of light, with an emphasis on the history, new ideas and future exploration of the field.},
