abstract: Over the past decade, the Anderson localization of light and a wide variety
  of associated phenomena have come to the forefront of research. Numerous investigations
  have been made into the underlying physics of how disorder affects transport in
  a crystalline lattice incorporating disorder. The physics involved relies on the
  analogy between the paraxial equation for electromagnetic waves and the Schr√∂dinger
  equation describing quantum phenomena. Experiments have revealed how wavefunctions
  evolve during the localization process, and have led to discoveries of new physics
  that are universal to wave systems incorporating disorder. This Review summarizes
  the phenomena associated with the transverse localization of light, with an emphasis
  on the history, new ideas and future exploration of the field.
