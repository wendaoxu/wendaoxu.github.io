abstract: We propose a relatively simple technique to infer the birefringence on single
  mode low-birefringence optical fibers based on the use of the Faraday effect. The
  theoretical model for Faraday rotation in the presence of nonnegligible fiber birefringence
  and a suitable measurement technique offer a fast and efficient way to determine
  low values of linear birefringence employing short fiber lengths. Alternative known
  techniques are not sensitive enough or they are of more difficult implementation.
  The method is used in only $âˆ¼$1 m-long single-mode optical fibers to obtain the
  upper-limit birefringence that can be tolerated in order to retain good current
  sensing sensitivity. The temperature dependence of the Faraday rotation and its
  causes are also investigated.
