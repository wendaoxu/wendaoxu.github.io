abstract: A simple scheme for laser frequency offset locking introduced in Cheng et
  al. (Opt Express 25:2752, 2017) has been improved by the use of a variable-capacitance
  diode. By employing this scheme with the optical phase lock loop, robust and precise
  laser frequency stabilization is achieved, and long-term laser frequency drift is
  expected to be substantially suppressed even in noisy circumstances. The optical
  frequency uncertainty becomes less than 10 $$upmu $$$Î¼$Hz for 1000 s averaging.
