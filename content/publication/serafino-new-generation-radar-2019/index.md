abstract: This paper reviews on the latest advances in microwave photonics applied
  to radar systems, tracing the evolutions of functionalities in the photonic radar
  toward a new generation of enhanced-performance systems. Photonics is demonstrated
  to enable a new generation of miniaturized, heterogeneous, and distributed radars,
  i.e., future radars on chip with different features, working in different radio
  spectral regions, and organized in spatially distributed sensors for the enhanced
  detection of a wider range of target properties. In these systems, the use of photonics
  assures benefits in terms of frequency flexibility, accuracy, and computational
  load reduction. Innovative capabilities supported by the photonic approach are presented,
  such as the use of coherent sparse bands for the synthesis of ultrawide bands, the
  use of distributed sensors for multiple-input multiple-output detections, and the
  use of an ultrawide band photonics-based receiver for radio frequency spectrum scanning.
  The presented novel concepts will open the way to new research activities both in
  photonic technology and radar systems, contributing to the development of a new
  generation of remote sensing systems. This expanding cross fertilization will lead
  to exciting and challenging research activities in the years to come.
