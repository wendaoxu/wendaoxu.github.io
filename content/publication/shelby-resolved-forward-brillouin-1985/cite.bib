 abstract = {Forward light scattering by the thermally excited acoustic eigenmodes of an optical fiber produce numerous narrow lines not predicted by the bulk-interaction theory of Brillouin scattering. Optical heterodyne detection has been used to resolve the scattering spectrum which begins at about 20 MHz and extends to the detection limit.},
