abstract: Forward light scattering by the thermally excited acoustic eigenmodes of
  an optical fiber produce numerous narrow lines not predicted by the bulk-interaction
  theory of Brillouin scattering. Optical heterodyne detection has been used to resolve
  the scattering spectrum which begins at about 20 MHz and extends to the detection
  limit.
