abstract: Forward Brillouin scattering behavior of a holey fiber (HF) is investigated
  experimentally. The shear and longitudinal acoustic velocities are evaluated from
  measurements of forward and backward Brillouin scattering, respectively. Experimentally
  obtained results reveal that the acoustic velocity ratio, given as /spl alpha/ (=shear
  velocity V/sub S//longitudinal velocity V/sub L/), decreases as the ratio of the
  total air-hole area to fiber cross-sectional area becomes large. This means that
  increasing the air-hole area in an HF's cross section lowers the shear velocity
  with respect to the mixed tortional-radial (TR/sub 2m/) modes.
