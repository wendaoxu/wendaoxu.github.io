 abstract = {Integrated photonics hold potential for signal processing but some operations are difficult to perform in all-optical devices. Here, Shin et al. use the coupling between coherent photons and phonons in nanophotonic waveguides to demonstrate frequency-selective, narrow-linewidth radiofrequency photonic filters.},
