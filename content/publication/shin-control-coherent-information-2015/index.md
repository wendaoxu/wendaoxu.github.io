abstract: Integrated photonics hold potential for signal processing but some operations
  are difficult to perform in all-optical devices. Here, Shin et al. use the coupling
  between coherent photons and phonons in nanophotonic waveguides to demonstrate frequency-selective,
  narrow-linewidth radiofrequency photonic filters.
