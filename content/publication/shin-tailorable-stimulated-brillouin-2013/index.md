abstract: Nanoscale modal confinement is known to radically enhance the effect of
  intrinsic Kerr and Raman nonlinearities within nanophotonic silicon waveguides.
  By contrast, stimulated Brillouin-scattering nonlinearities, which involve coherent
  coupling between guided photon and phonon modes, are stifled in conventional nanophotonics,
  preventing the realization of a host of Brillouin-based signal-processing technologies
  in silicon. Here we demonstrate stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon waveguides,
  for the first time, through a new class of hybrid photonic--phononic waveguides.
  Tailorable travelling-wave forward-stimulated Brillouin scattering is realized---with
  over 1,000 times larger nonlinearity than reported in previous systems---yielding
  strong Brillouin coupling to phonons from 1 to 18 GHz. Experiments show that radiation
  pressures, produced by subwavelength modal confinement, yield enhancement of Brillouin
  nonlinearity beyond those of material nonlinearity alone. In addition, such enhanced
  and wideband coherent phonon emission paves the way towards the hybridization of
  silicon photonics, microelectromechanical systems and CMOS signal-processing technologies
  on chip.
