 abstract = {The guided acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) technique is applied to acoustic velocity estimation for single-mode fibers. The GAWBS measurement can be carried out with a simple experimental setup. This technique is used to measure the fluorine (F) concentration dependence of the shear wave velocity. As a result, it is clarified that the sound velocity of the shear wave decreases as F concentration increases. Moreover, the shear wave velocities obtained with this method are in good agreement with the values obtained for bulk glass by elastic property measurements.$<>$},
