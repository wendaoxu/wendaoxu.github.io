abstract: The guided acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) technique is applied
  to acoustic velocity estimation for single-mode fibers. The GAWBS measurement can
  be carried out with a simple experimental setup. This technique is used to measure
  the fluorine (F) concentration dependence of the shear wave velocity. As a result,
  it is clarified that the sound velocity of the shear wave decreases as F concentration
  increases. Moreover, the shear wave velocities obtained with this method are in
  good agreement with the values obtained for bulk glass by elastic property measurements.$<>$
