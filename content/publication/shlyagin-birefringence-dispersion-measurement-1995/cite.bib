 abstract = {We describe a method for measuring modal birefringence in optical fibers. It combines an interferometric technique with wavelength scanning and permits a precise nondestructive measurement of the birefringence along different sections of a long optical fiber. The experimental results for high-birefringence fibers, 10 and 100 m long, are presented. An accuracy of approximately 0.1% is achieved in the spectral range of 600--850 nm.},
