abstract: We describe a method for measuring modal birefringence in optical fibers.
  It combines an interferometric technique with wavelength scanning and permits a
  precise nondestructive measurement of the birefringence along different sections
  of a long optical fiber. The experimental results for high-birefringence fibers,
  10 and 100 m long, are presented. An accuracy of approximately 0.1% is achieved
  in the spectral range of 600--850 nm.
