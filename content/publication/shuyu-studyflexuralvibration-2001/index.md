abstract: An analytical method is presented for the flexural vibration of rectangular
  thin plates with free boundary conditions. Based on the apparent elasticity method,
  the flexural vibration of a rectangular thin plate is reduced to two one-dimensional
  flexural vibrations of slender rods. Then the two-dimensional flexural vibration
  of a rectangular thin plate with free boundary conditions is considered as the coupling
  of these two equivalent flexural vibrations with different equivalent elastic constants.
  It should be noted that these two equivalent flexural vibrations are different from
  the traditional one-dimensional flexural vibrations of slender rods. They are coupled
  to each other by the introduced mechanical coupling coefficient. The analytical
  solutions for the isotropic rectangular thin plate in flexural vibration are derived
  and the resonance frequency equation is obtained. The natural vibrational mode is
  analyzed and the frequency spectra are calculated. It is found that the normal modes
  and the natural frequencies of the rectangular thin plate in flexural vibration
  are abundant. Theoretical analyses show that one-dimensional flexural vibration
  of a slender rod based on the classical elementary flexural theory, as well as the
  stripe mode vibration of a rectangular thin plate is a limiting vibrational mode
  of rectangular thin plates. Experiments show that the measured resonance frequencies
  are in good agreeement with the calculated results, and the displacement nodal line
  pattern is also observed experimentally.
