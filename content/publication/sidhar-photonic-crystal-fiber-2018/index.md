abstract: 'With the tremendously growing demand for internet, developments in optical
  fiber technology are rapid. These fibers offer low propagation loss for longer lengths,
  high transmission rate, and high channel capacity and bandwidth. However, traditional
  fibers have very rigid design rules such as limited core diameter for single-mode
  operation and cut-off wavelengths. Photonic crystal fibers are a new class of fiber,
  which along with the benefits of conventional fibers provides unique properties
  such as endlessly single mode operation, no cut-off wavelength, and single mode
  operation with larger core diameters. PCFs work in two different modes: index-guiding
  mode and photonic bandgap mode. These fibers can be used in ophthalmology, dental
  imaging, military applications, and many more areas. This paper provides an overview
  of photonic crystal fiber and its different modes of operation and applications.'
