abstract: 'Ultrafast lasers are becoming increasingly widespread in science and industry
  alike. Fiber-based ultrafast laser sources are especially attractive because of
  their compactness, alignment-free setups, and potentially low cost. However, confining
  short pulses within a fiber core leads to high intensities, which drives a host
  of nonlinear effects. While these phenomena and their interactions greatly complicate
  the design of such systems, they can also provide opportunities for engineering
  new capabilities. Here, we report a new fiber amplification regime distinguished
  by the use of a dynamically evolving gain spectrum as a degree of freedom: as a
  pulse experiences nonlinear spectral broadening, absorption and amplification actively
  reshape both the pulse and the gain spectrum itself. The dynamic co-evolution of
  the field and excited-state populations supports pulses that can broaden spectrally
  by almost two orders of magnitude and well beyond the gain bandwidth, while remaining
  cleanly compressible to their sub-50-fs transform limit. Theory and experiments
  provide evidence that a nonlinear attractor underlies the management of the nonlinearity
  by the gain. Further research into these mutual, pulse-inversion propagation dynamics
  may address open scientific questions and pave the way toward simple, compact fiber
  sources that produce high-energy, sub-30-fs pulses.'
