 abstract = {We describe the design trade-offs that are at stake when optimizing few-mode fibers (FMFs) that support a high number ( \$\ge\$ 6) of LP modes. We particularly detail the design of 6-LP-mode fibers that allow to multiply the capacity by a tenfold factor (two modes being spatially non-degenerate and four modes being two times spatially degenerate). For low-differential-mode-group-delay (low-DMGD) FMFs adapted to strongly-coupled mode-division-multiplexed systems, trench-assisted graded-index-core profiles can be optimized to have Max \$\vert\$ DMGD \$\vert\$ &lt;10 ps/km and undesired leaky LP modes appropriately cut off, while all guided LP modes show good robustness (Bend Losses &lt;10 dB/turn at 10 mm bend radius). Such low-DMGD FMFs being sensitive to process variability, we show how fiber concatenations can efficiently compensate for this issue and that values &lt;25 ps/km can realistically be reached. For weakly-coupled FMFs adapted to weakly-coupled mode-division-multiplexed systems, step-index-core profiles can be optimized to have large effective index differences, \$\Delta n_\\rm eff\\$ , between the LP modes (Min \$\vert\$ \$\Delta n_\\rm eff\\$ \$\vert\$ &gt;1.0 × 10 \$\textasciicircum\-3\\$ ) to limit mode coupling and \$A_\\rm eff\\$ &gt;$∼$100 $μ$m \$\textasciicircum2\$ to limit intra-mode non-linearity with good mode robustness. For such weakly-coupled FMFs, sensitivity to process variability is small and main characteristics do not significantly change when variations are within the manufacturing tolerances. We also briefly discuss experimental validations.},
