abstract: We describe the design trade-offs that are at stake when optimizing few-mode
  fibers (FMFs) that support a high number ( $ge$ 6) of LP modes. We particularly
  detail the design of 6-LP-mode fibers that allow to multiply the capacity by a tenfold
  factor (two modes being spatially non-degenerate and four modes being two times
  spatially degenerate). For low-differential-mode-group-delay (low-DMGD) FMFs adapted
  to strongly-coupled mode-division-multiplexed systems, trench-assisted graded-index-core
  profiles can be optimized to have Max $vert$ DMGD $vert$ &lt;10 ps/km and undesired
  leaky LP modes appropriately cut off, while all guided LP modes show good robustness
  (Bend Losses &lt;10 dB/turn at 10 mm bend radius). Such low-DMGD FMFs being sensitive
  to process variability, we show how fiber concatenations can efficiently compensate
  for this issue and that values &lt;25 ps/km can realistically be reached. For weakly-coupled
  FMFs adapted to weakly-coupled mode-division-multiplexed systems, step-index-core
  profiles can be optimized to have large effective index differences, $Delta n_rm
  eff$ , between the LP modes (Min $vert$ $Delta n_rm eff$ $vert$ &gt;1.0 × 10 $textasciicircum-3$
  ) to limit mode coupling and $A_rm eff$ &gt;$∼$100 $μ$m $textasciicircum2$ to limit
  intra-mode non-linearity with good mode robustness. For such weakly-coupled FMFs,
  sensitivity to process variability is small and main characteristics do not significantly
  change when variations are within the manufacturing tolerances. We also briefly
  discuss experimental validations.
