abstract: We present a multimode Hamiltonian formulation for the problem of opto-acoustic
  interactions in optical waveguides. We develop a quantised Hamiltonian representation
  of the acoustic field and then introduce a full system with a simple opto-acoustic
  coupling that includes both photoelastic/electrostrictive and radiation pressure/moving
  boundary effects in a particularly transparent manner. The interaction is applied
  to a Fermi's golden rule calculation of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in uniform
  waveguides. The Heisenberg equations of motion are then used to obtain coupled mode
  equations for quantised envelope operators for the optical and acoustic fields.
  We show that the coupling coefficients obtained coincide with those established
  earlier. Our formalism provides a new basis for future work involving quantum photon
  and phonon noise in the low intensity limit, phonon--phonon scattering and anharmonicity
  effects.
