 abstract = {The fundamental equations for the isotropic elastic solid in the form of an infinite circular cylinder yield, beside the simple modes of vibration (longitudinal, torsional, flexural), more complicated modes. Altogether there is a threefold band of resonances with each resonance characterised by a triplet of integral indices (n, p, q) which are related to the nodes on the cylindrical surface and can be experimentally determined.As the boundary problem of the cylinder of finite length cannot be rigorously solved, some departure from experiment is to be anticipated. For the special case of resonances with vanishing axial components, the discrepancies can be limited by comparison with the corresponding resonances of a thin circular disc.},
