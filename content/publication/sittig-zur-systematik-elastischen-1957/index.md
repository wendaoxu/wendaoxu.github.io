abstract: The fundamental equations for the isotropic elastic solid in the form of
  an infinite circular cylinder yield, beside the simple modes of vibration (longitudinal,
  torsional, flexural), more complicated modes. Altogether there is a threefold band
  of resonances with each resonance characterised by a triplet of integral indices
  (n, p, q) which are related to the nodes on the cylindrical surface and can be experimentally
  determined.As the boundary problem of the cylinder of finite length cannot be rigorously
  solved, some departure from experiment is to be anticipated. For the special case
  of resonances with vanishing axial components, the discrepancies can be limited
  by comparison with the corresponding resonances of a thin circular disc.
