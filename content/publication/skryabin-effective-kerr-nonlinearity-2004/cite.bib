 abstract = {We predict a strong effective Kerr nonlinearity in hollow-core photonic crystal fibers filled with a Raman active gas which exceeds the intrinsic Kerr nonlinearity by 2 orders of magnitude. Two-color bright-bright and dark-bright solitons supported by this nonlinearity are found and the feasibility of their experimental observation is demonstrated.},
