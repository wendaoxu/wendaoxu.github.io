abstract: We predict a strong effective Kerr nonlinearity in hollow-core photonic
  crystal fibers filled with a Raman active gas which exceeds the intrinsic Kerr nonlinearity
  by 2 orders of magnitude. Two-color bright-bright and dark-bright solitons supported
  by this nonlinearity are found and the feasibility of their experimental observation
  is demonstrated.
