 abstract = {A stimulated Brillouin fiber ring laser with a spectral width of 2 kHz and an intrinsic linewidth of less than 30 Hz has been demonstrated. Applications of such a laser include laser linewidth narrowing, microwave frequency generation, high-rate amplitude modulation, and optical inertial rotation sensing.},
