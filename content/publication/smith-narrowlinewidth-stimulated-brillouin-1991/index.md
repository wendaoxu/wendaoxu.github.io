abstract: A stimulated Brillouin fiber ring laser with a spectral width of 2 kHz and
  an intrinsic linewidth of less than 30 Hz has been demonstrated. Applications of
  such a laser include laser linewidth narrowing, microwave frequency generation,
  high-rate amplitude modulation, and optical inertial rotation sensing.
