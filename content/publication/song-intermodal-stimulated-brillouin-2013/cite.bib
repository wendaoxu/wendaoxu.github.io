 abstract = {The characterization of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in an elliptic-core two-mode fiber (TMF) is experimentally demonstrated, where a mode selective coupler is applied for selective launching of LP01 or LP11 mode to the TMF. The intermodal SBS between counterpropagating LP01 and LP11 modes is observed for the first time, and its properties are presented in comparison with those of the SBS between identical modes.},
