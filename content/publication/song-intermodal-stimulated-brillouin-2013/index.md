abstract: The characterization of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in an elliptic-core
  two-mode fiber (TMF) is experimentally demonstrated, where a mode selective coupler
  is applied for selective launching of LP01 or LP11 mode to the TMF. The intermodal
  SBS between counterpropagating LP01 and LP11 modes is observed for the first time,
  and its properties are presented in comparison with those of the SBS between identical
  modes.
