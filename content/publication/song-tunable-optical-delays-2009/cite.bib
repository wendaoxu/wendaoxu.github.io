 abstract = {We demonstrate a novel kind of tunable optical delays based on dynamic grating generated by Brillouin scattering in an optical fiber. An axial strain gradient is applied to a 15 m section of a polarization-maintaining fiber, and the Brillouin reflection grating is generated position-selectively by controlling the optical frequencies of Brillouin pump waves. Tunable time delays of up to 132 ns are achieved with an 82 ns Gaussian pulse.},
