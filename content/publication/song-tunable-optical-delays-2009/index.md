abstract: We demonstrate a novel kind of tunable optical delays based on dynamic grating
  generated by Brillouin scattering in an optical fiber. An axial strain gradient
  is applied to a 15 m section of a polarization-maintaining fiber, and the Brillouin
  reflection grating is generated position-selectively by controlling the optical
  frequencies of Brillouin pump waves. Tunable time delays of up to 132 ns are achieved
  with an 82 ns Gaussian pulse.
