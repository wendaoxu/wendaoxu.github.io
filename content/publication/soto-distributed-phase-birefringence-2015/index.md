abstract: In this paper a technique to measure the distributed birefringence profile
  along optical fibers is proposed and experimentally validated. The method is based
  on the spectral correlation between two sets of orthogonally-polarized measurements
  acquired using a phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer (&#x03D5;OTDR).
  The correlation between the two measured spectra gives a resonance (correlation)
  peak at a frequency detuning that is proportional to the local refractive index
  difference between the two orthogonal polarization axes of the fiber. In this way
  the method enables local phase birefringence measurements at any position along
  optical fibers, so that any longitudinal fluctuation can be precisely evaluated
  with metric spatial resolution. The method has been experimentally validated by
  measuring fibers with low and high birefringence, such as standard single-mode fibers
  as well as conventional polarization-maintaining fibers. The technique has potential
  applications in the characterization of optical fibers for telecommunications as
  well as in distributed optical fiber sensing.
