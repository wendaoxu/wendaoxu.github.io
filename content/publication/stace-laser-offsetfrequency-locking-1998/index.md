abstract: Many applications of lasers in research and industry require that a slave
  laser can be frequency locked at some selectable offset frequency from a stable
  reference laser. Conventionally an optical phase lock circuit has been used to provide
  this frequency lock. In some applications there is no requirement to ensure phase
  coherency between the two lasers, and in these cases, the high bandwidth requirements
  of a phase-locked loop make the circuit much more complicated than necessary. We
  describe a much simpler frequency-locking circuit, based on a commercial frequency-to-voltage
  converter, which is capable of reducing frequency fluctuations between the lasers
  to less than 400 Hz for time scales longer than 0.1 s.
