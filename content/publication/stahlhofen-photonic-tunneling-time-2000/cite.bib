 abstract = {Frustrated total internal reflection is considered as the classical analog of quantum-mechanical tunneling. Here the tunneling time in frustrated total internal reflection is discussed. It is shown that the phase time allows for vanishing and negative barrier traversal times. The tunneling time is shown to be dominated by a time scale based on the Goos-HÃ¤nchen shift. The role of further nonspecular deformations of the transmitted beam is addressed. The resulting tunneling times are compared with experimental data.},
