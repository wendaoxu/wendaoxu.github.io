abstract: Frustrated total internal reflection is considered as the classical analog
  of quantum-mechanical tunneling. Here the tunneling time in frustrated total internal
  reflection is discussed. It is shown that the phase time allows for vanishing and
  negative barrier traversal times. The tunneling time is shown to be dominated by
  a time scale based on the Goos-HÃ¤nchen shift. The role of further nonspecular deformations
  of the transmitted beam is addressed. The resulting tunneling times are compared
  with experimental data.
