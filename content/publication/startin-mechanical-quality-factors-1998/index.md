abstract: We have measured the room temperature resonant quality factors Q for a large
  set of resonant modes for each of several fused silica blocks and one fused silica
  cylinder. The modal frequencies ranged from 7.8 to 50 kHz. Our best results were
  obtained when the samples were suspended in a single loop of fine wire. For every
  sample tested we have measured at least one mode with Q⩾107. Our highest Q for any
  sample measured was (1.86textpm0.06)×107 for a block resonating at 26.4 kHz. Our
  tests included several different types of high purity fused silica, but could not
  detect any significant differences in mechanical loss. We believe our Q measurements
  are limited by losses due to our suspensions, as Q depends strongly on the shape
  of each resonant mode and the proximity of each mode's nodal regions to the wire
  suspension points.
