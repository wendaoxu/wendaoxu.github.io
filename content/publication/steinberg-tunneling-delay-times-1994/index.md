abstract: We demonstrate that although the well-known analogy between the time-independent
  solutions for two-dimensional tunneling (e.g., frustrated total internal reflection)
  and tunneling through a one-dimensional potential barrier cannot, in general, be
  extended to the time domain, there are certain limits in which the delay times for
  the two problems obey a simple relationship. In particular, when an effective mass
  is chosen such that mc2=$hbarømega$, the ``classical'' traversal times for allowed
  transmission become identical for a photon of energy $hbarømega$ traversing an air
  gap between regions of index n and for a particle of mass m traversing the analogous
  square barrier of height V0 in one dimension. The quantum-mechanical group delays
  are also identical, given this effective mass, both for E≊V0 (θ≊θc) and for E$≫$V0
  (θ$łlþeta$c). (For a smoothly varying potential or index of refraction, the agreement
  persists for all values of E where the WKB approximation applies.) The same relation
  serves to equate the quantum-mechanical ``dwell'' times for any values of E and
  V0. On the other hand, in the ``deep tunneling'' limit, E$łl$V0 (θ≊$π$/2), one must
  choose mc2=n2$hbarømega$ in order to make the group delays equal for the two problems.
  These equivalences simplify certain calculations, and the two-dimensional analogy
  may also be useful for geometrically visualizing the tunneling process and the anomalously
  small group delays known to occur in the opaque limit. We also demonstrate that
  the equality of the group delays for transmission and reflection for lossless barriers
  follows from a simple intuitive argument based on time-reversal invariance, and
  discuss the extension of the result to the case of lossy barriers.
