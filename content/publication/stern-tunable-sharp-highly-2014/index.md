abstract: 'Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in optical fibers has long been used
  in frequency-selective optical signal processing, including in the realization of
  microwave-photonic (MWP) filters. In this work, we report a significant enhancement
  in the selectivity of SBS-based MWP filters. Filters having a single passband of
  250~MHz--1~GHz bandwidth are demonstrated, with selectivity of up to 44~dB. The
  selectivity of the filters is better than that of the corresponding previous arrangements
  by about 15~dB. The shape factor of the filters, defined as the ratio between their
  -20,dB bandwidth and their -3,dB bandwidth, is between 1.35 and 1.5. The central
  transmission frequency, bandwidth, and spectral shape of the passband are all independently
  adjusted. Performance enhancement is based on two advances, compared with previous
  demonstrations of tunable SBS-based MWP filters: (a)~the polarization attributes
  of SBS in standard, weakly birefringent fibers are used to discriminate between
  in-band and out-of-band components and (b)~a sharp and uniform power spectral density
  of the SBS pump waves is synthesized through external modulation of an optical carrier
  by broadband, frequency-swept waveforms. The signal-to-noise ratio of filtered radio-frequency
  waveforms and the linear dynamic range of the filters are estimated analytically
  and quantified experimentally. Lastly, a figure of merit for the performance of
  the filters is proposed and discussed. The filters are applicable to radio-over-fiber
  transmission systems.'
