abstract: Acoustic waves can serve as memory for optical information; however, propagating
  acoustic phonons in the gigahertz (GHz) regime decay on the nanosecond time scale.
  Usually this is dominated by intrinsic acoustic loss due to inelastic scattering
  of the acoustic waves and thermal phonons. Here we show a way to counteract the
  intrinsic acoustic decay of the phonons in a waveguide by resonantly reinforcing
  the acoustic wave via synchronized optical pulses. We experimentally demonstrate
  coherent on-chip storage in amplitude and phase up to 40 ns, 4 times the intrinsic
  acoustic lifetime in the waveguide. Through theoretical considerations, we anticipate
  that this concept allows for storage times up to microseconds within realistic experimental
  limitations while maintaining a GHz bandwidth of the optical signal.
