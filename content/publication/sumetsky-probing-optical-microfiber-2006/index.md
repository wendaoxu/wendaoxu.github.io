abstract: We demonstrate a novel, simple, and comprehensive method for probing optical
  microfiber surface and bulk distortions with subnanometer accuracy. The method employs
  a regular optical fiber as a probe that slides along a microfiber transmitting the
  fundamental mode. The fraction of radiation power absorbed in the probe depends
  on the local distribution of the mode propagating in the microfiber. From the measured
  variation of the absorbed power, we determine the variation of the effective microfiber
  radius, which takes into account both the microfiber radius and refractive index
  variations. Furthermore, we verify the cylindrical symmetry of the microfiber nonuniformities
  by probing the microfiber from different sides. These results explain observed transmission
  losses in silica microfibers and open broad opportunities for microfiber investigation.
