 abstract = {Fiber optic sensors are often used as acoustic sensors to detect sound waves because of their apparent advantages, such as anti-electromagnetic interference and strong adaptation to the environment. The transverse vibration mode of the fiber caused by the acoustic wave can be obtained, and the principle of the optical fiber sensor to detect the acoustic wave signal was explored by using a simple model. It is found that the acoustic wave can effectively cause the change in birefringence of the fiber only when the number of azimuthal modes is 2, and the acoustic wave was detected by using a fiber sensor. It is found, by analyzing the detection mechanism, that the spectral width is proportional to the acoustic impedance of the surrounding medium, and the acoustic interaction between the TR22 mode and the surrounding medium is much weaker than that of the TR21 mode. This provides a theoretical basis for the detection of acoustic signals by fiber optic sensors.},
