abstract: Fiber optic sensors are often used as acoustic sensors to detect sound waves
  because of their apparent advantages, such as anti-electromagnetic interference
  and strong adaptation to the environment. The transverse vibration mode of the fiber
  caused by the acoustic wave can be obtained, and the principle of the optical fiber
  sensor to detect the acoustic wave signal was explored by using a simple model.
  It is found that the acoustic wave can effectively cause the change in birefringence
  of the fiber only when the number of azimuthal modes is 2, and the acoustic wave
  was detected by using a fiber sensor. It is found, by analyzing the detection mechanism,
  that the spectral width is proportional to the acoustic impedance of the surrounding
  medium, and the acoustic interaction between the TR22 mode and the surrounding medium
  is much weaker than that of the TR21 mode. This provides a theoretical basis for
  the detection of acoustic signals by fiber optic sensors.
