abstract: We propose a new technique to selectively excite the fundamental mode in
  a few mode fiber (FMF). This method of excitation is made from a single mode fiber
  (SMF) which is inserted facing the FMF into an air-silica microstructured cane before
  the assembly is adiabatically tapered. We study theoretically and numerically this
  method by calculating the effective indices of the propagated modes, their amplitudes
  along the taper and the adiabaticity criteria, showing the ability to achieve an
  excellent selective excitation of the fundamental mode in the FMF with negligible
  loss. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed solution provides a successful
  mode conversion and allows an almost excellent fundamental mode excitation in the
  FMF (representing 99.8% of the total power).
