abstract: By guided acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS), an optical beam propagating
  in an optical fiber is scattered and the phase and/or state of polarization are
  modulated. As a basic study of a temperature sensor based on GAWBS, we have measured
  the temperature coefficient of depolarized-GAWBS-induced sideband frequencies in
  a silica core single-mode optical fiber. The experimental result shows that the
  temperature coefficient for TR/sub 25/ mode is 10 kHz//spl deg/C and that for TR/sub
  28/ mode is 14 kHz//spl deg/C, which agrees well with the analytically derived result.
