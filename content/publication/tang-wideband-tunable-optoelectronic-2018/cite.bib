 abstract = {A novel wideband tunable optoelectronic oscillator based on a microwave photonic filter (MPF) with an ultra-narrow passband is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The single-passband MPF is realized by cascading an MPF based on stimulated Brillouin scattering and an infinite impulse response (IIR) MPF based on an active fiber recirculating delay loop. The measured full width at half-maximum bandwidth of the cascaded MPFs is 150&#x00A0;kHz. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time realizing such a narrow passband in single-passband MPF. The oscillation frequency of the OEO can be tuned from 0 to 40&#x00A0;GHz owing to the wideband tunability of the MPF. Thanks to the ultrahigh mode selectivity of the IIR filter, the mode hopping is successfully suppressed. A stable microwave signal at 8.18&#x00A0;GHz is obtained with a phase noise of &#x2212;113&#x2009;&#x2009;dBc/Hz at 10&#x00A0;kHz, and the side mode noise is below &#x2212;95&#x2009;&#x2009;dBc/Hz. The signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 50&#x00A0;dB during the tuning process.},
