abstract: A novel wideband tunable optoelectronic oscillator based on a microwave
  photonic filter (MPF) with an ultra-narrow passband is proposed and experimentally
  demonstrated. The single-passband MPF is realized by cascading an MPF based on stimulated
  Brillouin scattering and an infinite impulse response (IIR) MPF based on an active
  fiber recirculating delay loop. The measured full width at half-maximum bandwidth
  of the cascaded MPFs is 150&#x00A0;kHz. To the best of my knowledge, this is the
  first time realizing such a narrow passband in single-passband MPF. The oscillation
  frequency of the OEO can be tuned from 0 to 40&#x00A0;GHz owing to the wideband
  tunability of the MPF. Thanks to the ultrahigh mode selectivity of the IIR filter,
  the mode hopping is successfully suppressed. A stable microwave signal at 8.18&#x00A0;GHz
  is obtained with a phase noise of &#x2212;113&#x2009;&#x2009;dBc/Hz at 10&#x00A0;kHz,
  and the side mode noise is below &#x2212;95&#x2009;&#x2009;dBc/Hz. The signal-to-noise
  ratio exceeds 50&#x00A0;dB during the tuning process.
