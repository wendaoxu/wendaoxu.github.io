abstract: Mode coupling at bends in optical fibers supporting one or only a few guided
  modes is analyzed by considering the local normal modes for the corresponding straight
  waveguide. Matrix elements giving the strength of coupling between guided modes
  at a corner bend, and for coupling between guided modes and radiation modes, are
  calculated as a function of guiding strength for this \"geometrical\" effect. The
  correction to these matrix elements due to the longitudinal strain in a bent fiber
  is also determined. The increase in propagation constant for the fundamental mode
  of a fiber wrapped in a coil of constant radius is calculated from information on
  the coupling strengths and mode propagation constants. The phase shift and attenuation
  of the fundamental mode caused by a spatially periodic microbending of the fiber
  axis are also considered. Finally, potential applications of these effects in fiber-optic
  devices such as mode converters, phase shifters, switches, and sensors are discussed.
