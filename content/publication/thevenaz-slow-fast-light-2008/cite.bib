 abstract = {The ubiquitous role of optical fibres in modern photonic systems has stimulated research to realize slow and fast light devices directly in this close-to-perfect transmission line. Recent progress in developing optically controlled delays in optical fibres, operating under normal environmental conditions and at telecommunication wavelengths, has paved the way towards real applications for slow and fast light. This review presents the state-of-the-art research in this fascinating field and possible outcomes in the near future.},
