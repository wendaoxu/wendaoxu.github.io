abstract: The ubiquitous role of optical fibres in modern photonic systems has stimulated
  research to realize slow and fast light devices directly in this close-to-perfect
  transmission line. Recent progress in developing optically controlled delays in
  optical fibres, operating under normal environmental conditions and at telecommunication
  wavelengths, has paved the way towards real applications for slow and fast light.
  This review presents the state-of-the-art research in this fascinating field and
  possible outcomes in the near future.
