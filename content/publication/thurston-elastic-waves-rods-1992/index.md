abstract: This paper is a review of elastic waves in rods. This mature subject has
  important new consequences in optical fibers. The modulation or scattering of light
  by acoustic waves in optical fibers can be either harmful, as in catastrophic stimulated
  backward Brillouin scattering, or it can be put to practical use. While much of
  the paper is a tutorial description of basic knowledge about rod vibrations, several
  experiments are described that involve the interaction of light with vibrations
  in optical fibers. These include light modulation by thermally excited rod modes
  in an optical fiber, Brillouin gain measurements in fibers that are both acoustically
  and optically guiding, and some optical communication applications of stimulated
  Brillouin scattering. Reference is also made to other uses of acousto-optics in
  fibers.
