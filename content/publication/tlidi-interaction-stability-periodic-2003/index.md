abstract: We analytically and numerically study the role of the homogeneous zero mode
  on the interaction between two modulational instabilities. Periodic and localized
  structures (LSs) are considered in two transverse dimensions. We consider a real-order
  parameter description for a passive optical cavity driven by an external coherent
  field, valid close to the onset of optical bistability. A global description of
  pattern formation in both monostable and bistable regimes is given. We show that
  the interaction between the modulational modes and the zero mode modifies the existence
  and the stability of diffractive patterns. In particular, this interaction induces
  a coexistence between two different types of phase locked hexagonal structures.
  We also consider the interaction between two separated LSs. An analytical expression
  for the interaction potential in terms of modified Bessel functions is derived.
  Numerical simulations confirm the analytical predictions.
