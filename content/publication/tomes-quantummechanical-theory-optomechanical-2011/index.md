abstract: We analyze how to exploit Brillouin scattering of light from sound for the
  purpose of cooling optomechanical devices and present a quantum-mechanical theory
  for Brillouin cooling. Our analysis shows that significant cooling ratios can be
  obtained with standard experimental parameters. A further improvement of cooling
  efficiency is possible by increasing the dissipation of the optical anti-Stokes
  resonance.
