abstract: Single-mode optical wave guiding properties of silica and silicon subwavelength-diameter
  wires are studied with exact solutions of Maxwell's equations. Single mode conditions,
  modal fields, power distribution, group velocities and waveguide dispersions are
  studied. It shows that air-clad subwavelength-diameter wires have interesting properties
  such as tight-confinement ability, enhanced evanescent fields and large waveguide
  dispersions that are very promising for developing future microphotonic devices
  with subwavelength-width structures.
