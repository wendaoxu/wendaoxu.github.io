abstract: Silica waveguides with diameters larger than the wavelength of transmitted
  light are widely used in optical communications, sensors and other applications1,2,3.
  Minimizing the width of the waveguides is desirable for photonic device applications,
  but the fabrication of low-loss optical waveguides with subwavelength diameters
  remains challenging because of strict requirements on surface roughness and diameter
  uniformity4,5,6,7. Here we report the fabrication of subwavelength-diameter silica
  `wires' for use as low-loss optical waveguides within the visible to near-infrared
  spectral range. We use a two-step drawing process to fabricate long free-standing
  silica wires with diameters down to 50,nm that show surface smoothness at the atomic
  level together with uniformity of diameter. Light can be launched into these wires
  by optical evanescent coupling. The wires allow single-mode operation, and have
  an optical loss of less than 0.1,dB,mm-1. We believe that these wires provide promising
  building blocks for future microphotonic devices with subwavelength-width structures.
