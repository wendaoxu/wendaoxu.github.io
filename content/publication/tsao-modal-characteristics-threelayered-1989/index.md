abstract: By invoking Debye potentials, we formulate exact eigenvalue equations and
  the corresponding field distributions for general, three-layered, radially stratified,
  dielectric, and nonferromagnetic metal, optical fibers. By using cross products
  of Bessel functions, which may be regarded as the basic functional elements of the
  eigenvalue equations, a comparison is made between the properties of a three-layer
  structure and a simple step-index profile, and a simple graphical solution is obtained.
  The technique is applied to several practical structures, including two-layer fibers
  having a central index depression in the core, ring-core fibers, W fibers, and progressively
  stepped three-layered structures. The mathematical procedure is simple, and the
  results are of interest to optical fiber designers.
