abstract: 'We use the interplay between polarization-dependent gain and frequency-dependent
  polarization eigenmodes of a twisted (elliptically-birefringent) medium and demonstrate
  a tunable sub-megahertz optical feature at room temperature without resonators or
  loss.Authors: L. Qian, N. Choksi, Y. Liu, R. Ghasemi, University of TorontoAccess
