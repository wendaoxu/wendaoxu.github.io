abstract: We report a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber that is engineered so as
  to strongly suppress higher-order modes, i.e., to provide robust LP01 single-mode
  guidance in all the wavelength ranges where the fiber guides with low loss. Encircling
  the core is a single ring of nontouching glass elements whose modes are tailored
  to ensure resonant phase-matched coupling to higher-order core modes. We show that
  the resulting modal filtering effect depends on only one dimensionless shape parameter,
  akin to the well-known d/&#x039B; parameter for endlessly single-mode solid-core
  PCF. Fabricated fibers show higher-order mode losses some &#x223C;100 higher than
  for the LP01 mode, with LP01 losses &lt;0.2&#x2009;&#x2009;dB/m in the near-infrared
  and a spectral flatness &#x223C;1&#x2009;&#x2009;dB over a &gt;110&#x2009;&#x2009;THz
  bandwidth.
