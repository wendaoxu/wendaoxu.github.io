abstract: In twisted single-mode optical fibers the polarization of light is affected
  by an elastooptically induced optical activity and by a modification of any linear
  birefringence present. These effects are discussed theoretically and demonstrated
  experimentally. The activity/twist ratio is $α$/$τ$ $∼eq$ 0.13 dots 0.16 universally
  in weakly guiding silica fibers. Twisted fibers may be used as polarization rotators.
  A fiber with a textpm68$^∘$ double twist operates as a fast/slow mode interchanger,
  suitable for delay equalization.
