abstract: In this paper, a complete analysis of an analog fiber-optic link employing
  a low-biased Mach-Zehnder modulator followed by optical amplification with an erbium-doped
  fiber amplifier is presented. The expressions for RF gain, RF noise figure, second-
  and third-order intercept points, and spurious-free dynamic range are derived. Experimental
  data are employed to support the analytical results, and the optimal bias points
  for the metrics are demonstrated.
