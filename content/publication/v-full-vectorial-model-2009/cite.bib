 abstract = {The propagation of pulses through waveguides with sub-wavelength features, inhomogeneous transverse structure, and high index contrast cannot be described accurately using existing models in the presence of nonlinear effects. Here we report the development of a generalised full vectorial model of nonlinear pulse propagation and demonstrate that, unlike the standard pulse propagation formulation, the z-component of guided modes plays a key role for these new structures, and results in generalised definitions of the nonlinear coefficient $γ$, Aeff , and mode orthognality. While new definitions reduce to standard definitions in some limits, significant differences are predicted, including a factor of ~2 higher value for $γ$, for emerging waveguides and microstructured fibers.},
