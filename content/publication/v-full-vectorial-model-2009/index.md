abstract: The propagation of pulses through waveguides with sub-wavelength features,
  inhomogeneous transverse structure, and high index contrast cannot be described
  accurately using existing models in the presence of nonlinear effects. Here we report
  the development of a generalised full vectorial model of nonlinear pulse propagation
  and demonstrate that, unlike the standard pulse propagation formulation, the z-component
  of guided modes plays a key role for these new structures, and results in generalised
  definitions of the nonlinear coefficient $γ$, Aeff , and mode orthognality. While
  new definitions reduce to standard definitions in some limits, significant differences
  are predicted, including a factor of ~2 higher value for $γ$, for emerging waveguides
  and microstructured fibers.
