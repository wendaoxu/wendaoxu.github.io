abstract: In the past decade there has been a surge in research at the boundary between
  photonics and phononics. Most efforts have centred on coupling light to motion in
  a high-quality optical cavity, typically geared towards manipulating the quantum
  state of a mechanical oscillator. It was recently predicted that the strength of
  the light--sound interaction would increase drastically in nanoscale silicon photonic
  wires. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such a giant overlap between near-infrared
  light and gigahertz sound co-localized in a small-core silicon wire. The wire is
  supported by a tiny pillar to block the path for external phonon leakage, trapping
  10>GHz phonons in an area of less than 0.1>$μ$m2. Because our geometry can also
  be studied in microcavities, it paves the way for complete fusion between the fields
  of cavity optomechanics and Brillouin scattering. The results bode well for the
  realization of optically driven lasers/sasers, isolators and comb generators on
  a densely integrated silicon chip.
