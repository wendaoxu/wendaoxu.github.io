abstract: 'So far, Brillouin scattering and cavity optomechanics have been mostly
  disconnected branches of research, although both deal with photon-phonon coupling.
  This begs for the development of a broader theory that contains both fields. Here,
  we derive the dynamics of optomechanical cavities from that of Brillouin-active
  waveguides. This explicit transition elucidates the link between phenomena such
  as Brillouin amplification and electromagnetically induced transparency. It proves
  that effects familiar from cavity optomechanics all have traveling-wave partners,
  but not vice versa. We reveal a close connection between two parameters of central
  importance in these fields: the Brillouin gain coefficient and the zero-point optomechanical
  coupling rate. This enables comparisons between systems as diverse as ultracold
  atom clouds, plasmonic Raman cavities, and nanoscale silicon waveguides. In addition,
  back-of-the-envelope calculations show that unobserved effects, such as photon-assisted
  amplification of traveling phonons, are now accessible in existing systems. Finally,
  we formulate both circuit- and cavity-oriented optomechanics in terms of vacuum
  coupling rates, cooperativities, and gain coefficients, thus reflecting the similarities
  in the underlying physics.'
