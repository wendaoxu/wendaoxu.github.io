 abstract = {We reexamine the derivation of the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation in the case of nonaxially uniform optical fibers, taking into account the longitudinal and spectral evolutions of all pertinent linear parameters. Our theory leads to an improved form of this equation that highlights an additional term, which ensures the conservation of the total photon number in nonuniform optical fibers in the absence of attenuation. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of this theory in the context of a Raman-induced soliton self-frequency shift, emission of Cherenkov radiation, and a soliton blue shift.},
