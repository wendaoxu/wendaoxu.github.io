abstract: We reexamine the derivation of the generalized nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation
  in the case of nonaxially uniform optical fibers, taking into account the longitudinal
  and spectral evolutions of all pertinent linear parameters. Our theory leads to
  an improved form of this equation that highlights an additional term, which ensures
  the conservation of the total photon number in nonuniform optical fibers in the
  absence of attenuation. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of this theory
  in the context of a Raman-induced soliton self-frequency shift, emission of Cherenkov
  radiation, and a soliton blue shift.
