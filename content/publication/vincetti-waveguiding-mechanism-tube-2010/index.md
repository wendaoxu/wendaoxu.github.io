abstract: Waveguiding mechanism and modal characteristics of hollow core fibers consisting
  of a single or a regular arrangement of dielectric tubes are investigated. These
  fibers have been recently proposed as low loss, broadband THz waveguides. By starting
  from a description in terms of coupling between air and dielectric modes in a single
  tube waveguide, a simple and useful model is proposed and numerically validated.
  It is able to predict dispersion curves, high and low loss spectral regions, and
  the conditions to ensure the existence of low loss regions. In addition, it allows
  a better understanding of the role of the geometrical parameters and of the dielectric
  refractive index. The model is then applied to improve the tradeoff between low
  loss and effectively single mode propagation, showing that the best results are
  obtained with a heptagonal arrangement of the tubes.
