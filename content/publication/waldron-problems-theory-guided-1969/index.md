abstract: The wave equation for elastic waves in an isotropic solid is solved generally
  in Cartesian and in circular cylindrical coordinates. The solutions are applied
  in the study of a variety of guiding structures of circular and rectangular symmetry.
  In general, the wave functions do not satisfy the boundary conditions, but in special
  cases they do. From a study of these special cases it is possible to arrive at some
  useful results and to general principles which give some insight into the behavior
  of waveguides in general. The results and observations obtained are compared and
  where appropriate, with corresponding results for electromagnetic waveguides.
