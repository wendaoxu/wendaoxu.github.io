abstract: We design a partially suspended silicon nitride (Si3N4) slot waveguide on
  silica to realize efficient on-chip forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS).
  The slot waveguide can intensify radiation pressure close to the slot and simultaneously
  confine both optical and acoustic modes, resulting in an enhanced FSBS gain on the
  order of 300 W-1m-1. The acoustic radiation loss is significantly suppressed due
  to the strong acoustic coupling in the narrow slot waveguides. We analyze the impacts
  of structural parameters on the SBS properties, which produces the optimal parameters
  for maximum SBS gain. Based on the nonlinear coupled-mode equations, we compare
  the performance of Stokes amplification between the Si3N4 slot waveguides and the
  silicon nanowires. Simulation results indicate that the Si3N4 slot waveguides with
  low linear loss can offer a larger net Stokes amplification than silicon waveguides
  under moderate pump power. Such approach enables efficient on-chip SBS devices in
  CMOS-compatible Si3N4 platform.
