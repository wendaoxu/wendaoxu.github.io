 abstract = {Forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS) is observed in a standard 2-km-long highly nonlinear fiber. The frequency of FSBS arising from multiple radially guided acoustic resonances is observed up to gigahertz frequencies. The tight confinement of the light and acoustic field enhances the interaction and results in a large gain coefficient of 34.7 W-1 at a frequency of 933.8 MHz. We also find that the profile on the anti-Stokes side of the pump beam have lineshapes that are asymmetric, which we show is due to the interference between FSBS and the optical Kerr effect. The measured FSBS resonance linewidths are found to increase linearly with the acoustic frequency. Based on this scaling, we conclude that dominant contribution to the linewidth is from surface damping due to the fiber jacket and structural nonuniformities along the fiber.},
