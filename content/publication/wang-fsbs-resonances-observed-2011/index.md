abstract: Forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS) is observed in a standard
  2-km-long highly nonlinear fiber. The frequency of FSBS arising from multiple radially
  guided acoustic resonances is observed up to gigahertz frequencies. The tight confinement
  of the light and acoustic field enhances the interaction and results in a large
  gain coefficient of 34.7 W-1 at a frequency of 933.8 MHz. We also find that the
  profile on the anti-Stokes side of the pump beam have lineshapes that are asymmetric,
  which we show is due to the interference between FSBS and the optical Kerr effect.
  The measured FSBS resonance linewidths are found to increase linearly with the acoustic
  frequency. Based on this scaling, we conclude that dominant contribution to the
  linewidth is from surface damping due to the fiber jacket and structural nonuniformities
  along the fiber.
