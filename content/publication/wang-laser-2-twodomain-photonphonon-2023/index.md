abstract: The laser is one of the greatest inventions in history. Because of its ubiquitous
  applications and profound societal impact, the concept of the laser has been extended
  to other physical domains including phonon lasers and atom lasers. Quite often,
  a laser in one physical domain is pumped by energy in another. However, all lasers
  demonstrated so far have only lased in one physical domain. We have experimentally
  demonstrated simultaneous photon and phonon lasing in a two-mode silica fiber ring
  cavity via forward intermodal stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) mediated by
  long-lived flexural acoustic waves. This two-domain laser may find potential applications
  in optical/acoustic tweezers, optomechanical sensing, microwave generation, and
  quantum information processing. Furthermore, we believe that this demonstration
  will usher in other multidomain lasers and related applications.
