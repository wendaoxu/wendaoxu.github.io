abstract: Motivated by the realization of the Dirac point (DP) with a double-cone
  structure for optical field in the negative-zero-positive index metamaterial (NZPIM),
  the lateral shift and tunneling time of photon tunneling through a frustrated total
  internal reflection structure containing a NZPIM barrier are investigated by employing
  Artman&#x2019;s stationary phase method. Near the DP, the lateral shift can vary
  from positive to negative and the photon tunneling displays a superluminal dynamic.
  Because of the Hartman effect, both lateral shift and tunneling time tend to a saturation
  value when the barrier thickness increases. These results may lead to potential
  applications in integral optics and optical-based devices and also suggest analogous
  phenomena of valance electron in single-layered carbon graphene.
