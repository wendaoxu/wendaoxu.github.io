abstract: We report on the fabrication of a seven-cell-core and three-ring-cladding
  large-pitch Kagome-lattice hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF) with a hypocycloid-shaped
  core structure. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that the design
  of this core shape enhances the coupling inhibition between the core and cladding
  modes and offers optical attenuation with a baseline of $âˆ¼$180 dB/km over a transmission
  bandwidth larger than 200 THz. This loss figure rivals the state-of-the-art photonic
  bandgap HC-PCF while offering an approximately three times larger bandwidth and
  larger mode areas. Also, it beats the conventional circular-core-shaped Kagome HC-PCF
  in terms of the loss. The development of this novel (to our knowledge) HC-PCF has
  potential for a number of applications in which the combination of a large optical
  bandwidth and a low loss is a prerequisite.
