abstract: The output performance of large mode area (LMA) all-fiber laser are affected
  by the stripping ability of cladding light, which is consisting of the residual
  pump light and cladding mode signal light. The common method of stripping cladding
  light is to recoat the DCF (double clad fiber) with a high index gel, but it strips
  the cladding light quickly within the first few millimeters and makes the local
  temperature too high. In order to strip the power of cladding light uniformly over
  the length of the fiber, a method corroding the inner cladding layer to special
  shape is proposed. The Monte Carlo algorithm is used to simulate the performance
  of this method. The results show that it has the attenuation ability of 26dB and
  can strip the cladding light uniformly without making local temperature too high.
