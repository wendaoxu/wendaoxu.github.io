 abstract = {In this work, we present a nonlinear silicon nitride waveguide. These waveguide are fabricated by readily available PECVD, conventional contact UV-lithography and high-temperature annealing techniques, thus dramatically reducing the processing complexity and cost. By patterning the waveguide structures firstly and then carrying out a high-temperature annealing process, not only sufficient waveguide thickness can be achieved, which gives more freedom to waveguide dispersion control, but also the material absorption loss in the waveguides be greatly reduced. The linear optical loss of the fabricated waveguide with a cross-section of 2.0 &#x00D7; 0.58 &#x00B5;m2 was measured to be as low as 0.58 dB/cm. The same loss level is demonstrated over a broad wavelength range from 1500 nm to 1630 nm. Moreover, the nonlinear refractive index of the waveguide was determined to be ~6.94 &#x00D7; 10&#x2212;19 m2/W, indicating that comparable nonlinear performance with their LPCVD counterparts is expected. These silicon nitride waveguides based on a PECVD deposition platform can be useful for the development of more complicated on-chip nonlinear optical devices or circuits.},
