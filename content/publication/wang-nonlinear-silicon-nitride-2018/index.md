abstract: In this work, we present a nonlinear silicon nitride waveguide. These waveguide
  are fabricated by readily available PECVD, conventional contact UV-lithography and
  high-temperature annealing techniques, thus dramatically reducing the processing
  complexity and cost. By patterning the waveguide structures firstly and then carrying
  out a high-temperature annealing process, not only sufficient waveguide thickness
  can be achieved, which gives more freedom to waveguide dispersion control, but also
  the material absorption loss in the waveguides be greatly reduced. The linear optical
  loss of the fabricated waveguide with a cross-section of 2.0 &#x00D7; 0.58 &#x00B5;m2
  was measured to be as low as 0.58 dB/cm. The same loss level is demonstrated over
  a broad wavelength range from 1500 nm to 1630 nm. Moreover, the nonlinear refractive
  index of the waveguide was determined to be ~6.94 &#x00D7; 10&#x2212;19 m2/W, indicating
  that comparable nonlinear performance with their LPCVD counterparts is expected.
  These silicon nitride waveguides based on a PECVD deposition platform can be useful
  for the development of more complicated on-chip nonlinear optical devices or circuits.
