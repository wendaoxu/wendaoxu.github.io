 abstract = {A fiber loop mirror (FLM) filter with two-stage polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) and polarization controllers (PCs) is presented. The transmission function of this FLM is calculated in detail by Jones matrix. The wavelength interval depends on both the PMFs and the PCs. The side frequencies can be restrained by choosing appropriate length of the PMFs. Furthermore, an erbium-doped fiber ring laser based on this FLM filter is proposed and demonstrated. Stable single-, double- and triple-wavelength are achieved respectively. The 3dB line-width is less than 0.03nm, and the fluctuation of wavelength and peak power is less than 0.05nm and 0.1dB in 30 minutes.},
