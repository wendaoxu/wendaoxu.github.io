abstract: A fiber loop mirror (FLM) filter with two-stage polarization-maintaining
  fibers (PMFs) and polarization controllers (PCs) is presented. The transmission
  function of this FLM is calculated in detail by Jones matrix. The wavelength interval
  depends on both the PMFs and the PCs. The side frequencies can be restrained by
  choosing appropriate length of the PMFs. Furthermore, an erbium-doped fiber ring
  laser based on this FLM filter is proposed and demonstrated. Stable single-, double-
  and triple-wavelength are achieved respectively. The 3dB line-width is less than
  0.03nm, and the fluctuation of wavelength and peak power is less than 0.05nm and
  0.1dB in 30 minutes.
