abstract: We review the method of producing adiabatic optical micro- and nanofibers
  using a hydrogen/oxygen flame brushing technique. The flame is scanned along the
  fiber, which is being simultaneously stretched by two translation stages. The tapered
  fiber fabrication is reproducible and yields highly adiabatic tapers with either
  exponential or linear profiles. Details regarding the setup of the flame brushing
  rig and the various parameters used are presented. Information available from the
  literature is compiled and further details that are necessary to have a functioning
  pulling rig are included. This should enable the reader to fabricate various taper
  profiles, while achieving adiabatic transmission of $âˆ¼$99% for fundamental mode
  propagation. Using this rig, transmissions ranging from 85% to 95% for higher order
  modes in an optical nanofiber have been obtained.
