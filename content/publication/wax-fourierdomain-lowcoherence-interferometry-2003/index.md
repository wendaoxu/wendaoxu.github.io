abstract: We present a novel method for obtaining depth-resolved spectra for determining
  scatterer size through elastic-scattering properties. Depth resolution is achieved
  with a white-light source in a Michelson interferometer with the mixed signal and
  reference fields dispersed by a spectrograph. The spectrum is Fourier transformed
  to yield the axial spatial cross correlation between the signal and reference fields
  with near 1-textmum depth resolution. Spectral information is obtained by windowing
  to yield the scattering amplitude as a function of wave number. The technique is
  demonstrated by determination of the size of polystyrene microspheres in a subsurface
  layer with subwavelength accuracy. Application of the technique to probing the size
  of cell nuclei in living epithelial tissues is discussed.
