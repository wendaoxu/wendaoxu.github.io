abstract: Electromagnetically induced transparency is a quantum interference effect
  observed in atoms and molecules, in which the optical response of an atomic medium
  is controlled by an electromagnetic field. We demonstrated a form of induced transparency
  enabled by radiation-pressure coupling of an optical and a mechanical mode. A control
  optical beam tuned to a sideband transition of a microoptomechanical system leads
  to destructive interference for the excitation of an intracavity probe field, inducing
  a tunable transparency window for the probe beam. Optomechanically induced transparency
  may be used for slowing and on-chip storage of light pulses via microfabricated
  optomechanical arrays.
