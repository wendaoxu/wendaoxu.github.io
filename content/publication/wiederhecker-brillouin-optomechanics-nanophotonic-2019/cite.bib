 abstract = {The interaction between light and mesoscopic mechanical degrees of freedom has been investigated under various perspectives, from spectroscopy in condensed matter, optical tweezer particle trapping, and long-haul optical fiber communication system penalties to gravitational-wave detector noise. In the context of integrated photonics, two topics with dissimilar origins---cavity optomechanics and guided wave Brillouin scattering---are rooted in the manipulation and control of the energy exchange between trapped light and mechanical modes. In this tutorial, we explore the impact of optical and mechanical subwavelength confinement on the interaction among these waves, coined as Brillouin optomechanics. At this spatial scale, optical and mechanical fields are fully vectorial and the common intuition that more intense fields lead to stronger interaction may fail. Here, we provide a thorough discussion on how the two major physical effects responsible for the Brillouin interaction---photoelastic and moving-boundary effects---interplay to foster exciting possibilities in this field. In order to stimulate beginners into this growing research field, this tutorial is accompanied by all the discussed simulation material based on a widespread commercial finite-element solver.},
