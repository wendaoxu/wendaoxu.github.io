abstract: The interaction between light and mesoscopic mechanical degrees of freedom
  has been investigated under various perspectives, from spectroscopy in condensed
  matter, optical tweezer particle trapping, and long-haul optical fiber communication
  system penalties to gravitational-wave detector noise. In the context of integrated
  photonics, two topics with dissimilar origins---cavity optomechanics and guided
  wave Brillouin scattering---are rooted in the manipulation and control of the energy
  exchange between trapped light and mechanical modes. In this tutorial, we explore
  the impact of optical and mechanical subwavelength confinement on the interaction
  among these waves, coined as Brillouin optomechanics. At this spatial scale, optical
  and mechanical fields are fully vectorial and the common intuition that more intense
  fields lead to stronger interaction may fail. Here, we provide a thorough discussion
  on how the two major physical effects responsible for the Brillouin interaction---photoelastic
  and moving-boundary effects---interplay to foster exciting possibilities in this
  field. In order to stimulate beginners into this growing research field, this tutorial
  is accompanied by all the discussed simulation material based on a widespread commercial
  finite-element solver.
