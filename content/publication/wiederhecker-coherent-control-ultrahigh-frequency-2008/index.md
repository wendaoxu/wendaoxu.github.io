abstract: Ultrahigh frequency acoustic resonances (∽2 GHz) trapped within the glass
  core (∽1 $μ$m diameter) of a photonic crystal fiber are selectively excited through
  electrostriction using laser pulses of duration 100 ps and energy 500 pJ. Using
  precisely timed sequences of such driving pulses, we achieve coherent control of
  the acoustic resonances by constructive or destructive interference, demonstrating
  both enhancement and suppression of the vibrations. A sequence of 27 resonantly-timed
  pulses provides a 100-fold increase in the amplitude of the vibrational mode. The
  results are explained and interpreted using a semianalytical theory, and supported
  by precise numerical simulations of the complex light-matter interaction.
