 abstract = {Integrated silicon waveguides serve as a transmission medium for on-chip signaling, and they are also used to form various types of devices for communication and signal processing applications. In this paper, we present some recent progress in tailoring the physical properties of the silicon waveguides such as chromatic dispersion and nonlinearity. Using slot structures, both dispersion and nonlinearity can be tailored by more than an order of magnitude, which is a very useful feature in many signal processing applications.},
