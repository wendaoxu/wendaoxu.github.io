abstract: Integrated silicon waveguides serve as a transmission medium for on-chip
  signaling, and they are also used to form various types of devices for communication
  and signal processing applications. In this paper, we present some recent progress
  in tailoring the physical properties of the silicon waveguides such as chromatic
  dispersion and nonlinearity. Using slot structures, both dispersion and nonlinearity
  can be tailored by more than an order of magnitude, which is a very useful feature
  in many signal processing applications.
