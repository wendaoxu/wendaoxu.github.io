abstract: We investigate the role of the spatial evolution of the acoustic field in
  stimulated Brillouin scattering processes in short high-gain structures. When the
  gain is strong enough that the gain length becomes comparable to the acoustic wave
  decay length of order 100 microns, standard approximations treating the acoustic
  field as a local response no longer apply. Treating the acoustic evolution more
  accurately, we find that the backward SBS gain of sub-millimetre long waveguides
  is significantly reduced from the value obtained by the conventional treatment because
  the acoustic mode requires several decay lengths to build up to its nominal value.
  In addition, the corresponding resonance line is broadened with the development
  of side bands. In contrast, we argue that intra-mode forward SBS is not expected
  to show these effects. Our results have implications for several recent proposals
  and experiments on high-gain stimulated Brillouin scattering in short semiconductor
  waveguides.
