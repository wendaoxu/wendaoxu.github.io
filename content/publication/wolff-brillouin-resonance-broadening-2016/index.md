abstract: 'We study the impact of structural variations (that is slowly varying geometry
  aberrations and internal strain fields) on the width and shape of the stimulated
  Brillouin scattering (SBS) resonance in nanoscale waveguides. We find that they
  lead to an inhomogeneous resonance broadening through two distinct mechanisms: firstly,
  the acoustic frequency is directly influenced via mechanical nonlinearities; secondly,
  the optical wave numbers are influenced via the opto-mechanical nonlinearity leading
  to an additional acoustic frequency shift via the phase-matching condition. We find
  that this second mechanism is proportional to the opto-mechanical coupling and,
  hence, related to the SBS-gain itself. It is absent in intra-mode forward SBS, while
  it plays a significant role in backward scattering. In backward SBS increasing the
  opto-acoustic overlap beyond a threshold defined by the fabrication tolerances will
  therefore no longer yield the expected quadratic increase in overall Stokes amplification.
  Finally, we illustrate in a numerical example that in backward SBS and inter-mode
  forward SBS the existence of two broadening mechanisms with opposite sign also opens
  the possibility to compensate the effect of geometry-induced broadening. Our results
  can be transferred to other micro- and nano-structured waveguide geometries such
  as photonic crystal fibres.'
