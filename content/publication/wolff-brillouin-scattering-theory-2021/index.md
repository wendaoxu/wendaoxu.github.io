abstract: Brillouin scattering is an important and interesting nonlinear effect involving
  the interaction between optical and acoustic fields in optical waveguides. It is
  increasingly useful in the field of photonics, where it supplies a tunable ultra-narrow
  linewidth response that can be used for applications including sensing, filtering,
  and lasing, as well as the acoustic storage of optical pulses. This tutorial gives
  an overview of the fundamentals of Brillouin scattering aimed at newcomers to the
  field, and covers the physics underlying the interaction, the mathematical theory,
  and setup details of foundational Brillouin experiments.
