abstract: Recent theoretical studies of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in nanoscale
  devices have led to intense research effort dedicated to the demonstration and application
  of this nonlinearity in on-chip systems. The key feature of SBS in integrated photonic
  waveguides is that small, high-contrast waveguides are predicted to experience powerful
  optical forces on the waveguide boundaries, which are predicted to further boost
  the SBS gain that is already expected to grow dramatically in such structures because
  of the higher mode confinement alone. In all recent treatments, the effect of radiation
  pressure is included separately from the scattering action that the acoustic field
  exerts on the optical field. In contrast to this, we show here that the effects
  of radiation pressure and motion of the waveguide boundaries are inextricably linked.
  Central to this insight is a new formulation of the SBS interaction that unifies
  the treatment of light and sound, incorporating all relevant interaction mechanisms---radiation
  pressure, waveguide boundary motion, electrostriction, and photoelasticity---from
  a rigorous thermodynamic perspective. Our approach also clarifies important points
  of ambiguity in the literature, such as the nature of edge effects with regard to
  electrostriction and of body forces with respect to radiation pressure. This new
  perspective on Brillouin processes leads to physical insight with implications for
  the design and fabrication of SBS-based nanoscale devices.
