 abstract = {We describe a technique for the measurement of the birefringence spatial distribution in a single-mode optical fiber with a resolution of 1 m. This technique is based on a polarization optical time-domain reflectometer using a rotary linear polarizer. We report results performed on different types of fibers: standard step-index and dispersion shifted fibers.},
