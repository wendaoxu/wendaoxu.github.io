abstract: 'We describe a technique for the measurement of the birefringence spatial
  distribution in a single-mode optical fiber with a resolution of 1 m. This technique
  is based on a polarization optical time-domain reflectometer using a rotary linear
  polarizer. We report results performed on different types of fibers: standard step-index
  and dispersion shifted fibers.'
