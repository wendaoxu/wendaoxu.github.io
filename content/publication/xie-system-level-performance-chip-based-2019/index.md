abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) filters using on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering
  offer great potential for next-generation radio frequency (RF) applications due
  to the unprecedented high spectral resolution, flexible programmability, and ultra-wideband
  frequency agility. Although impressive functionalities have been reported, limited
  link performance, due to the amplification noise induced by the Brillouin gain process,
  hinders the practical deployment in existing RF applications. In this paper, we
  present the first comprehensive numerical and experimental study of chip-based Brillouin
  MWP bandpass filters implemented in a range of link configurations. In the experiments,
  key RF performance figures of merit, including link gain, noise figure, passband
  resolution, bandwidth tunability, and passband extinction of chip-based Brillouin
  filters are experimentally investigated and numerically analyzed. This comprehensive
  study points out a preferable filter scheme with optimized system-level performance.
  The numerical model developed in this paper allows for extrapolations to further
  improve the performance. The systematic work establishes a feasible design route
  for achieving high link-performance chip-based Brillouin microwave photonic bandpass
  filters.
