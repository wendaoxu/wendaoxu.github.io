abstract: Coherent interactions between electromagnetic and matter waves lie at the
  heart of quantum science and technology. However, the diffraction nature of light
  has limited the scalability of many atom-light--based quantum systems. We use the
  optical fields in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber to spatially split, reflect,
  and recombine a coherent superposition state of free-falling 85Rb atoms to realize
  an inertia-sensitive atom interferometer. The interferometer operates over a diffraction-free
  distance, and the contrasts and phase shifts at different distances agree within
  one standard error. The integration of phase coherent photonic and quantum systems
  here shows great promise to advance the capability of atom interferometers in the
  field of precision measurement and quantum sensing with miniature design of apparatus
  and high efficiency of laser power consumption. Matter-wave interference is demonstrated
  with light in a micrometer-size hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. Matter-wave
  interference is demonstrated with light in a micrometer-size hollow-core photonic
  crystal fiber.
