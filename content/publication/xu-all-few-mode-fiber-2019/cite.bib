 abstract = {We propose and demonstrate an all few-mode fiber (FMF) passively mode-locked figure-8 cavity laser, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. In this laser, all the components including the used gain medium of few-mode erbium-doped fiber (FM-EDF) are based on and connected with FMF. A homemade wavelength division multiplexing-mode selective coupler (WDM-MSC) makes it possible for 976 nm pump light source to be simultaneously converted to LP11 mode and multiplexed into the FM-EDF. The obtained cylindrical vector beams (CVBs) pulses exhibit a signal-to-noise ratio 78 dB with fundamental repetition rate of 3.51 MHz. Furthermore, CVBs with the purity of over 94% have been obtained by simply adjusting the polarization controllers. The all-FMF mode-locked fiber laser could not only have the potential applications for MDM telecommunication and high-power fiber laser seed sources, but also is a perfect platform for nonlinear science.},
