 abstract = {Strong stimulated optomechanical coupling to the fundamental flexural acoustic mode of a tapered fiber is demonstrated, broadening access to frequencies, and increasing interaction-times for applications. A theoretical model featuring unique propagation dependent behavior is introduced.},
