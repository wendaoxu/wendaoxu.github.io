abstract: Strong stimulated optomechanical coupling to the fundamental flexural acoustic
  mode of a tapered fiber is demonstrated, broadening access to frequencies, and increasing
  interaction-times for applications. A theoretical model featuring unique propagation
  dependent behavior is introduced.
