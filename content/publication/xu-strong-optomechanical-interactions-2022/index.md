abstract: Traveling-wave optomechanical interactions, known as Brillouin interactions,
  have now been established as a powerful and versatile resource for photonic sources,
  sensors, and radio-frequency processors. However, established Brillouin-based interactions
  with sufficient interaction strengths involve short phonon lifetimes, which critically
  limit their performance for applications including radio-frequency filtering and
  optomechanical storage devices. Here, we investigate a new paradigm of optomechanical
  interactions with fundamental acoustic modes, where interaction strength is decoupled
  from phonon lifetimes, enabling the uniquely desirable combination of high optomechanical
  coupling, long phonon lifetimes, tunable phonon frequencies, and single-sideband
  amplification. Using sensitive four-wave mixing spectroscopy controlling for noise
  and spatial mode coupling, optomechanical interactions with long $>$ 2 $mu s$ phonon
  lifetimes and strong $>$ 400 $Wtextasciicircum-1 mtextasciicircum-1$ coupling are
  observed in a tapered fiber. In addition, we demonstrate novel phonon self-interference
  effects resulting from the unique combination of an axially varying device geometry
  with long phonon lifetimes. A generalized theoretical model, in excellent agreement
  with experiments, is developed with broad applicability to inhomogeneous optomechanical
  systems.
