 abstract = {Traveling-wave optomechanical interactions, known as Brillouin interactions, have now been established as a powerful and versatile resource for photonic sources, sensors, and radio-frequency processors. However, established Brillouin-based interactions with sufficient interaction strengths involve short phonon lifetimes, which critically limit their performance for applications, including radio-frequency filtering and optomechanical storage devices. Here, we investigate a new paradigm of optomechanical interactions with tightly confined fundamental acoustic modes, which enables the unique and desirable combination of high optomechanical coupling, long phonon lifetimes, tunable phonon frequencies, and single-sideband amplification. Using sensitive four-wave mixing spectroscopy controlling for noise and spatial mode coupling, optomechanical interactions with long &gt;2\textmus phonon lifetimes and strong &gt;400W -1 m -1 coupling are observed in a tapered fiber. In addition, we demonstrate novel phonon self-interference effects resulting from the unique combination of an axially varying device geometry with long phonon lifetimes. A generalized theoretical model, in excellent agreement with experiments, is developed with broad applicability to inhomogeneous optomechanical systems.},
