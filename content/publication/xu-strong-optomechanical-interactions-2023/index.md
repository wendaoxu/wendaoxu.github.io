abstract: Traveling-wave optomechanical interactions, known as Brillouin interactions,
  have now been established as a powerful and versatile resource for photonic sources,
  sensors, and radio-frequency processors. However, established Brillouin-based interactions
  with sufficient interaction strengths involve short phonon lifetimes, which critically
  limit their performance for applications, including radio-frequency filtering and
  optomechanical storage devices. Here, we investigate a new paradigm of optomechanical
  interactions with tightly confined fundamental acoustic modes, which enables the
  unique and desirable combination of high optomechanical coupling, long phonon lifetimes,
  tunable phonon frequencies, and single-sideband amplification. Using sensitive four-wave
  mixing spectroscopy controlling for noise and spatial mode coupling, optomechanical
  interactions with long &gt;2textmus phonon lifetimes and strong &gt;400W -1 m -1
  coupling are observed in a tapered fiber. In addition, we demonstrate novel phonon
  self-interference effects resulting from the unique combination of an axially varying
  device geometry with long phonon lifetimes. A generalized theoretical model, in
  excellent agreement with experiments, is developed with broad applicability to inhomogeneous
  optomechanical systems.
