 abstract = {A scheme to perform ultra-narrow filter bandwidth and high frequency selectivity microwave photonic filter (MPF) with wide tuning range is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The ultra-narrow bandwidth of the MPF is implemented by a Brillouin laser resonator, which is composed of a cascaded ring Fabry--Pérot (CR-FP) resonator formed by a main cavity with a cavity length of 100~m and a secondary cavity with a cavity length of 10~m. A Brillouin laser resonator is formed by the main cavity to obtain an extremely narrow comb-shaped Brillouin gain spectrum. The Vernier effect of the double ring cavity can effectively suppress the side modes, thereby realizing the narrow linewidth Brillouin laser filtering. Besides, two identical tunable lasers provide the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) pump light and optical carrier signal for this device respectively. After the interaction between the Brillouin gain spectrum and the optical modulation signal, the filter passband can be stably tuned by simply changing the wavelength of SBS pump light. The experimental results show that the microwave photonic filter can be stably tuned in the frequency range of 0--20~GHz, the out-of-band rejection ratio is about 20~dB, and the minimum 3~dB bandwidth is about 114 Hz.},
