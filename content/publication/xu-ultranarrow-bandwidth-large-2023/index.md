abstract: A scheme to perform ultra-narrow filter bandwidth and high frequency selectivity
  microwave photonic filter (MPF) with wide tuning range is proposed and experimentally
  demonstrated. The ultra-narrow bandwidth of the MPF is implemented by a Brillouin
  laser resonator, which is composed of a cascaded ring Fabry--PÃ©rot (CR-FP) resonator
  formed by a main cavity with a cavity length of 100~m and a secondary cavity with
  a cavity length of 10~m. A Brillouin laser resonator is formed by the main cavity
  to obtain an extremely narrow comb-shaped Brillouin gain spectrum. The Vernier effect
  of the double ring cavity can effectively suppress the side modes, thereby realizing
  the narrow linewidth Brillouin laser filtering. Besides, two identical tunable lasers
  provide the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) pump light and optical carrier
  signal for this device respectively. After the interaction between the Brillouin
  gain spectrum and the optical modulation signal, the filter passband can be stably
  tuned by simply changing the wavelength of SBS pump light. The experimental results
  show that the microwave photonic filter can be stably tuned in the frequency range
  of 0--20~GHz, the out-of-band rejection ratio is about 20~dB, and the minimum 3~dB
  bandwidth is about 114 Hz.
