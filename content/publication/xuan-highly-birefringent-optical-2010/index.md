abstract: Highly birefringent (Hi-Bi) air-clad silica microfibers (MFs) with wavelength
  and sub-wavelength scale transverse dimensions are studied theoretically and experimentally.
  Hi-Bi MFs are taper-drawn from the standard SMF-28 single mode fibers that are ``pre-processed''
  by ``cutting away'' parts of the silica cladding on opposite sides of the fiber
  with a femtosecond infrared laser. Such Hi-Bi MFs have approximately elliptical
  cross-sections and are approximated by a three-layer model comprising a small central
  Ge-doped region surrounded by an elliptical silica region and an air-cladding. Theoretical
  modeling shows that phase and group birefringence of the order 10-2 can be achieved
  with such air-clad Hi-Bi MFs. Experiments with an air-clad elliptical fiber with
  a major diameter of 0.9$Î¼$m and a minor/major diameter ratio of 0.9 demonstrated
  a group birefringence of ~ 0.015, agreeing well with the theoretical predictions.
  The Hi-Bi MFs are useful for micron/nanoscale polarization maintaining transmission
  and phase-sensitive interferometric sensors.
