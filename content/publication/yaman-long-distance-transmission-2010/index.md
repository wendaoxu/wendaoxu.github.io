abstract: Using multimode fibers for long-haul transmission is proposed and demonstrated
  experimentally. In particular few-mode fibers (FMFs) are demonstrated as a good
  compromise since they are sufficiently resistant to mode coupling compared to standard
  multimode fibers but they still can have large core diameters compared to single-mode
  fibers. As a result these fibers can have significantly less nonlinearity and at
  the same time they can have the same performance as single-mode fibers in terms
  of dispersion and loss. In the absence of mode coupling it is possible to use these
  fibers in the single-mode operation where all the data is carried in only one of
  the spatial modes throughout the fiber. It is shown experimentally that the single-mode
  operation is achieved simply by splicing single-mode fibers to both ends of a 35-km-long
  dual-mode fiber at 1310 nm. After 35 km of transmission, no modal dispersion or
  excess loss was observed. Finally the same fiber is placed in a recirculating loop
  and 3 WDM channels each carrying 6 Gb/s BPSK data were transmitted through1050 km
  of the few-mode fiber without modal dispersion.
