abstract: We designed and fabricated a high-power cladding light stripper (CLS) by
  combining a fiber-etched CLS with a cascaded polymer-recoated CLS. The etched fiber
  reorganizes the numerical aperture (NA) distribution of the cladding light, leading
  to an increase in the leakage power and a flatter distribution of the leakage proportion
  in the cascaded polymer-recoated fiber. The index distribution of the cascaded polymer-recoated
  fiber is carefully designed to ensure an even leakage of cladding light. More stages
  near the index of 1.451 are included to disperse the heat. The CLS is capable of
  working consistently under 1187&#x00A0;W of cladding light with an attenuation of
  26.59&#x00A0;dB, and the highest local temperature is less than 35&#x00B0;C.
