abstract: We propose a precision and flexible measurement method for the beat length
  of birefringence optical fiber (BOF) with a hybrid Sagnac interferometer formed
  with a single mode fiber directional coupler and BOFs. The measurement error equation
  was obtained based on error estimation theory and it was found that there is an
  optimum length for certain BOF under test. The measurement error can be less than
  0.001 mm with 1 pm wavelength precision and 0.1 mm fiber length precision. With
  a high performance wavelength interrogator technology and a special designed fiber
  length measurement method, a beat length measurement setup was built and the measurement
  standard deviation of 3.08 Ã— 10-4 mm was achieved with 250 measurement samples for
  solid core polarization maintaining photonic crystal fibers (PM-PCFs). The beat
  length stability of two PM-PCFs with different structure sizes has been measured
  and compared. The result demonstrated that the birefringence temperature characteristic
  of the PM-PCFs may be dependent on structure sizes.
