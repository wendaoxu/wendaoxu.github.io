 abstract = {Recent advances in microwave photonic systems are reviewed, including system architectures for photonic generation of low-phase-noise microwave signals, linearly chirped microwave waveforms, and random microwave waveforms, photonic processing of microwave signals using microwave photonic filters based on incoherent and coherent detection, and radio over fiber links based on coherent detection with increased spectral efficiency and sensitivity. Microwave photonic systems for high-speed and high-resolution optical sensing are also discussed.},
