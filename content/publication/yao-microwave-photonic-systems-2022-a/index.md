abstract: Recent advances in microwave photonic systems are reviewed, including system
  architectures for photonic generation of low-phase-noise microwave signals, linearly
  chirped microwave waveforms, and random microwave waveforms, photonic processing
  of microwave signals using microwave photonic filters based on incoherent and coherent
  detection, and radio over fiber links based on coherent detection with increased
  spectral efficiency and sensitivity. Microwave photonic systems for high-speed and
  high-resolution optical sensing are also discussed.
