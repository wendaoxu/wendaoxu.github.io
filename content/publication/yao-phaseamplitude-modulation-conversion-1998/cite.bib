 abstract = {We demonstrate an effective method for converting a phase modulated signal to an amplitude modulated signal by employing the powerful Brillouin selective sideband amplification technique. We further demonstrate several applications of this technique in various photonic systems, including microwave frequency multiplication, photonic microwave signal mixing with gain, microwave harmonic signal up-conversion, and coherent heterodyne signal detection.},
