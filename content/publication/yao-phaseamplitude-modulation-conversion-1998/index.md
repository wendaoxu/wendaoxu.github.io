abstract: We demonstrate an effective method for converting a phase modulated signal
  to an amplitude modulated signal by employing the powerful Brillouin selective sideband
  amplification technique. We further demonstrate several applications of this technique
  in various photonic systems, including microwave frequency multiplication, photonic
  microwave signal mixing with gain, microwave harmonic signal up-conversion, and
  coherent heterodyne signal detection.
