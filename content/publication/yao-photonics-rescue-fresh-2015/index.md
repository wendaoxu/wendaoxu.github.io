abstract: Extensively researched in recent years, microwave photonic filters can be
  implemented either in an incoherent operational regime or in a coherent operational
  regime. In the incoherent regime, a delay-line configuration is usually used with
  a finite-impulse response (FIR) or infinite-impulse response (IIR); to avoid optical
  interference, an incoherence light source or a laser array is used. Filter tuning
  and reconfiguration are achieved by changing the time delay and the tap coefficients.
  In the coherent regime, however, a single wavelength is needed, and the filter's
  spectral response is translated directly from the spectral response of an optical
  filter. Thus, a coherent microwave filter requires a well-defined optical filter
  with a precisely controlled spectral response. This article reviews the techniques
  for implementing both incoherent and coherent tunable and reconfigurable microwave
  photonic filters.
