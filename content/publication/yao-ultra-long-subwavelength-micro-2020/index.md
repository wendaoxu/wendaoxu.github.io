abstract: Subwavelength diameter micro/nanofiber (MNF) provides excellent platform
  for many applications. In this work, we fabricate subwavelength diameter MNFs with
  ultra-long waist and analyze the propagation loss origin for such fibers. Transmittance
  as high as 99.4% is measured for MNF with a waist length of 10 cm and diameter of
  1.2$Î¼$m, and the loss is mainly resulted from the modal leakage of the taper. However,
  when the MNF is getting longer and thinner, the intrinsic surface roughness induced
  during the fabrication process overrides the modal leakage and plays a major role
  in the propagation loss. Our study reveals existence of an ultimate transmission
  limitation for ultra-long MNFs.
