abstract: The most basic and generic configuration, which consists of a unidirectional
  coupling between a ring resonator and a waveguide, is considered. The fundamental
  working equations required to describe the associated power transfer are derived
  and the application of this geometry to a variety of optical phenomena is discussed.
  These phenomena include 'add/dropping' of optical beams, add/drop filtering and
  optical power switching.
