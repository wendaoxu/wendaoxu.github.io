abstract: We study the Brillouin scattering behavior in several single-mode fibers
  with different waveguide characteristics in terms of their longitudinal mode structures
  in the gain spectrum, linewidth narrowing, and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS)
  threshold levels. Evolution from spontaneous to SBS is investigated by monitoring
  the Brillouin line-shape and the behavior of the longitudinal acoustooptic resonance
  modes that exist in the core. We compare our results with the current theory of
  Brillouin scattering generated from noise in the undepleted pump approximation.
  We also present experimentally Brillouin gain spectra in the highly depleted pump
  regime, where there is no analytical solution, by showing the evolution of the gain
  spectrum as a function of the injected laser intensity.
