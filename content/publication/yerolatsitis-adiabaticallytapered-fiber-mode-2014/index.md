abstract: Simple all-fiber three-mode multiplexers were made by adiabatically merging
  three dissimilar single-mode cores into one multimode core. This was achieved by
  collapsing air holes in a photonic crystal fiber and (in a separate device) by fusing
  and tapering separate telecom fibers in a fluorine-doped silica capillary. In each
  case the LP01 mode and both LP11 modes were individually excited from three separate
  input cores, with losses below 0.3 and 0.7 dB respectively and mode purities exceeding
  10 dB. Scaling to more modes is challenging, but would be assisted by using single-mode
  fibers with a smaller ratio of cladding to core diameter.
