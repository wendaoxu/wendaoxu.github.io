abstract: We describe a silica hollow-core fiber for mid-infrared transmission with
  a minimum attenuation of 34 dB/km at 3050 nm wavelength. The design is based on
  the use of a negative curvature core wall. Similar fiber designed for longer wavelengths
  has a transmission band extending beyond 4 textmum.
