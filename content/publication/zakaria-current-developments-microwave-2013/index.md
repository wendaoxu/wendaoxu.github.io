abstract: This paper presents a compilation of important review in the development
  of microwave filters for wideband technology used in previous years. The major research
  work for each year is reviewed. Several wideband filters based on the planar and
  non-planar circuits are compared and examined in order to propose a new topology
  of wideband filter using Suspended Stripline Structure (SSS). More importantly,
  this new proposed structure will be integrated with the Defects Ground Structure
  (DGS) to form an advanced hybrid system for wideband applications. This system will
  produce the band-pass and band-stop responses simultaneously in order to discriminate
  between the desired and undesired signals in the wideband spectrum. The proposed
  system outlined in this paper, featuring new innovation in hybrid structure as well
  as providing an insight of the direction of future research works. The contribution
  of this study is useful for applications where the reduction of physical volume
  is very important, while maintaining its good performance such as Ultra-Wideband
  (UWB), commercial radar as well as the wideband warfare receiver. As for future
  works, integration techniques between the UWB filter and DGS will be designed and
  analyzed to form an advanced new microwave device in order to produce bandpass and
  bandreject response in the same structure simultaneously.
