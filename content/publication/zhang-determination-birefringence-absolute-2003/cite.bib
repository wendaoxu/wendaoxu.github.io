 abstract = {A novel polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) system was developed using polarization maintaining (PM) optical fibers and fiber coupler to measure birefringence properties of samples. Polarization distortion due to PM fibers and coupler can be calibrated with different polarization states during two consecutive A-scans. By processing the analytical interference fringe signals derived from two orthogonal polarization detection channels, the system can be used to measure phase retardation and optic axis orientation. Standard wave plates with different orientation and retardation were used as samples to test the system and calibrating method. We have also applied this system to image biological sample such as beef tendon.},
