abstract: A novel polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) system
  was developed using polarization maintaining (PM) optical fibers and fiber coupler
  to measure birefringence properties of samples. Polarization distortion due to PM
  fibers and coupler can be calibrated with different polarization states during two
  consecutive A-scans. By processing the analytical interference fringe signals derived
  from two orthogonal polarization detection channels, the system can be used to measure
  phase retardation and optic axis orientation. Standard wave plates with different
  orientation and retardation were used as samples to test the system and calibrating
  method. We have also applied this system to image biological sample such as beef
  tendon.
