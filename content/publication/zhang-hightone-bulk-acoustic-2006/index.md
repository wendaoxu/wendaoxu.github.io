abstract: 'High-tone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs) have been fabricated on four
  types of substrates: c-axis sapphire, AT-cut crystal quartz, fused silica, and (100)
  single crystal silicon. Quality factors of the HBARs on the four substrates have
  been compared. Temperature effect on the Q and resonant frequency of the four types
  of HBARs has been investigated. This paper reports that acoustic absorption in fused
  silica decreases with increased temperature. Acoustic absorptions in the other three
  substrates increase with increased temperature. Also, temperature coefficients of
  frequency of HBARs on sapphire, crystal quartz, fused silica, and silicon have been
  investigated. Finally, acoustic velocities in the four substrates have been extracted
  by measuring the frequency difference between two successive resonances of the HEAR
  on the corresponding substrate, and their dependences on temperature have been investigated.
