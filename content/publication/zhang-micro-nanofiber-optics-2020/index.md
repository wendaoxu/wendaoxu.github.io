abstract: Micro-/nanofibers (MNFs) are optical fibers with diameters close to or below
  the wavelength of the guided light. These tiny fibers can offer engineerable waveguiding
  properties including optical confinement, fractional evanescent fields, and surface
  intensity, which is very attractive to optical sensing on the micro-/nano scale.
  In this review, we first introduce the basics of MNF optics and MNF optical sensors
  from physical and chemical to biological applications and review the progress and
  current status of this field. Then, we review and discuss hybrid MNF structures
  for advanced optical sensing by merging MNFs with functional structures including
  chemical indicators, quantum dots, dye molecules, plasmonic nanoparticles, 2-D materials,
  and optofluidic chips. Thirdly, we introduce the emerging trends in developing MNF-based
  advanced sensing technology for ultrasensitive, active, and wearable sensors and
  discuss the future prospects and challenges in this exciting research field. Finally,
  we end the review with a brief conclusion.
