abstract: COMSOL Multiphysics was used to simulate and analyze the transmission attenuation
  spectra of negative curvature hollowcore fiber (NCHCF) over the wavelength from
  2.7 $μ$m to 4.2 $μ$m. Effect of the thickness of capillaries and the distance between
  capillaries on confinement loss spectra was studied, which agreed well with the
  high-loss and low-loss bands predicted by the ARROW model. Based on mode confinement
  factor, a criterion for selecting the fundamental mode was proposed. Theoretical
  analysis has shown that the integral coefficient of 0.5 could effectively distinguish
  fundamental modes from high-ordered ones. This method was easy and accessible, and
  the error rate was fractional. This research could offer useful theoretic guidance
  for the design and fabrication of negative curvature hollow-core fiber.
