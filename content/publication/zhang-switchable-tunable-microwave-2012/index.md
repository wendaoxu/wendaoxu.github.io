abstract: A new structure that realizes a switchable microwave photonic filter, which
  can be readily switched between a bandpass filter and a notch filter, is presented.
  It is based on optical processing the sidebands of the RF-modulated signal that
  is obtained after a dual-drive Mach--Zehnder modulator (DDMZM), using stimulated
  Brillouin scattering (SBS) effects. Switching of the filter function is simply and
  conveniently obtained by changing the dc bias to the DDMZM. In addition, the center
  frequency of the switchable filter can be tuned over a wide frequency range. A detailed
  analysis and simulation of the DDMZM operation in conjunction with the SBS technique
  is presented in order to obtain the required optimum bias conditions for the DDMZM
  for realizing the switching action between the single-bandpass filter and the notch
  filter and also to select the optimum pump power for the SBS operation. Experimental
  results demonstrate the ability of this structure to switch between a high-resolution
  bandpass filter and a high-resolution notch filter, with Q values around 400--500,
  and the ability to operate over a frequency range of 2--20 GHz.
