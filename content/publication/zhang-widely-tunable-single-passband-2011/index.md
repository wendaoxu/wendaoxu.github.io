abstract: A new ultrawide continuously tunable single-passband microwave photonic
  filter with very high resolution, is presented. It is based on a stimulated Brillouin
  scattering technique using a phase modulated optical signal and a dual-sideband
  suppressed-carrier pump. Results are presented which demonstrate a 1- to 20-GHz
  measured tuning range, together with continuous tuning, extremely high resolution
  with a -3-dB bandwidth of only 20 MHz, a single passband, shape-invariant tuning,
  and a high out-of-band rejection of 31 dB.
