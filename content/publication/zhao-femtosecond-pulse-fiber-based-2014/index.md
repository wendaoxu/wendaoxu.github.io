abstract: Three kinds of pulse amplification techniques including chirped-pulse amplification
  (CPA), parabolic pulse amplification, and divided-pulse amplification (DPA) based
  on rare-earth doped fiber gain medium are reviewed. Large core area fiber and cladding-pumping
  technique compose the foundation of high average power, high pulse energy fiber
  CPA technology. Femtosecond pulses have been demonstrated at average powers of up
  to 830 W, pulse energies of up to 2.2 mJ and compressed pulse duration of 23 fs
  from different fiber CPA systems. The state-of-the-art performance of fiber CPA
  system to date is the simultaneous generation of 530 W, 1.3 mJ compressed femtosecond
  pulses at 400 kHz repetition rate. The balance between fiber gain, dispersion and
  nonlinearity is required for the self-similar propagation and thus the formation
  of pulses with parabolic intensity profile. Sub-33 fs pulses were demonstrated from
  a gain-cascaded parabolic amplification system. A newly emerging DPA technique is
  also reviewed. In addition, the applications of pulsed fiber amplifiers in the areas
  of supercontinuum generation and material micromachining system are also introduced.
