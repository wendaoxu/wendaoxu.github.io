abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of long-period fiber gratings (LPFGs) written
  in the two-mode fiber (TMF) by CO2 laser. Both uniform and tilted LPFGs were fabricated
  to provide the light coupling between LP01 mode and LP11 mode with a coupling efficiency
  of more than 99%. The writing efficiency and the bandwidth of the LPFG mode converter
  can be adjusted by changing the tilt angle of the tilted TMF-LPFGs. The torsion
  sensitivity of conventional and tilted LPFG mode converters were measured to be
  0.37 nm/(rad/m) and 0.50 nm/(rad/m), respectively. Two orthogonal vector modes (the
  HEeven 21and HEodd 21 modes) and corresponding orbital angular momentum state were
  successfully obtained at the resonance wavelength. The proposed LPFG mode converter
  could be used as not only a high efficiency wavelength tunable mode converter in
  the mode division multiplexing system but also a high sensitive torsion sensor in
  the field of optical sensing.
