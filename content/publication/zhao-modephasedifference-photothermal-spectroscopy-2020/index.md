abstract: Laser spectroscopy outperforms electrochemical and semiconductor gas sensors
  in selectivity and environmental survivability. However, the performance of the
  state-of-the-art laser sensors is still insufficient for many high precision applications.
  Here, we report mode-phase-difference photothermal spectroscopy with a dual-mode
  anti-resonant hollow-core optical fiber and demonstrate all-fiber gas (acetylene)
  detection down to ppt (parts-per-trillion) and,$<$1% instability over a period of
  3,hours. An anti-resonant hollow-core fiber could be designed to transmit light
  signals over a broad wavelength range from visible to infrared, covering molecular
  absorption lines of many important gases. This would enable multi-component gas
  detection with a single sensing element and pave the way for ultra-precision gas
  sensing for medical, environmental and industrial applications.
