abstract: We report the observation of three-mode optoacoustic parametric interactions
  of the type predicted to cause parametric instabilities in a 77-m-long, high-optical-power
  cavity that uses suspended sapphire mirrors. Resonant interaction occurs between
  two distinct optical modes and an acoustic mode of one mirror when the difference
  in frequency between the two optical cavity modes is close to the frequency of the
  acoustic mode. Experimental results validate the theory of parametric instability
  in high-power optical cavities, and demonstrate tunable parametric gain $âˆ¼$10-2
  and more than 20dB amplification of a high-order optical mode power generated by
  an applied acoustic signal.
