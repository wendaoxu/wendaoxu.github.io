abstract: A tunable microwave photonic notch filter with ultrahigh radio frequency
  (RF) rejection ratio is achieved by using a dual-drive Mach-Zender modulator and
  a microring resonator. In addition, we dedicated to clarify the mechanisms of the
  microwave photonic notch filters based on a microring resonator under both overcoupled
  and undercoupled states and the performance differences between these two situations
  are investigated in detail. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the
  cancellation microwave photonic notch filter with ultrahigh RF rejection ratio can
  be achieved with both undercoupled and overcoupled microring resonators. Besides,
  an RF rejection ratio exceeding 50 dB was achieved for a microring resonator with
  an optical extinction ratio of only 4 dB, where a 46-dB enhancement from optical
  to RF response is obtained. Also, the bandwidth of the microwave photonic filter
  can tuned from 0.65 to 2.2 GHz by adjusting the coupling ratio of the ring resonator.
  Meanwhile, by tuning the wavelength of the optical carrier, the filtering frequency
  can be tuned and a tuning range of about 25 GHz was achieved. The implementation
  is much simpler and more economical compared with previous reports and has great
  potential in monolithic integration of microwave photonic filters on chip.
