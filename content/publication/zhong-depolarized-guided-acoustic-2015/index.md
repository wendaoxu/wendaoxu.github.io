abstract: By performing quantum-noise-limited optical heterodyne detection, we observe
  polarization noise in light after propagation through a hollow-core photonic crystal
  fiber (PCF). We compare the noise spectrum to the one of a standard fiber and find
  an increase of noise even though the light is mainly transmitted in air in a hollow-core
  PCF. Combined with our simulation of the acoustic vibrational modes in the hollow-core
  PCF, we are offering an explanation for the polarization noise with a variation
  of guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS). Here, instead of modulating
  the strain in the fiber core as in a solid core fiber, the acoustic vibrations in
  hollow-core PCF influence the effective refractive index by modulating the geometry
  of the photonic crystal structure. This induces polarization noise in the light
  guided by the photonic crystal structure.
