 abstract = {Microwave photonics is a promising and rapidly developing interdisciplinary field. It combines microwave and photonic techniques to generate, transmit, process, and manipulate microwave signals by using the advantages of broadband, high frequency, and low loss provided by photonics. As an important branch of microwave photonics, the microwave photonic filter (MPF) can overcome the limitations set by traditional electronic technology and can realize advanced signal processing in modern communication systems due to its higher performance, selectivity, and flexibility. This review provides a comprehensive overview of MPFs, including fundamental principles, typical structures, and key applications. Additionally, the microwave photonic integration is a very important tendence because of its advantages of small size, light weight, low power consumption, and low cost. The recent advances in integrated MPF are also reviewed.},
