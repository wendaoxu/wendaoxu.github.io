abstract: Microwave photonics is a promising and rapidly developing interdisciplinary
  field. It combines microwave and photonic techniques to generate, transmit, process,
  and manipulate microwave signals by using the advantages of broadband, high frequency,
  and low loss provided by photonics. As an important branch of microwave photonics,
  the microwave photonic filter (MPF) can overcome the limitations set by traditional
  electronic technology and can realize advanced signal processing in modern communication
  systems due to its higher performance, selectivity, and flexibility. This review
  provides a comprehensive overview of MPFs, including fundamental principles, typical
  structures, and key applications. Additionally, the microwave photonic integration
  is a very important tendence because of its advantages of small size, light weight,
  low power consumption, and low cost. The recent advances in integrated MPF are also
  reviewed.
