 abstract = {We present an all-fiber sensor for simultaneous measurement of temperature and strain. The sensing head is formed by introducing a fiber Bragg grating into a high-birefringence fiber loop mirror that acts as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer for temperature and strain discrimination. A sensing resolution of \textpm1$^∘$C in temperature and \textpm21$μɛ$ in strain has been experimentally achieved over a temperature range of 60$^∘$C and strain range of 600$μɛ$.},
