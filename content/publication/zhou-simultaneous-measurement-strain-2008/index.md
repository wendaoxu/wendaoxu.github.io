abstract: We present an all-fiber sensor for simultaneous measurement of temperature
  and strain. The sensing head is formed by introducing a fiber Bragg grating into
  a high-birefringence fiber loop mirror that acts as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer
  for temperature and strain discrimination. A sensing resolution of textpm1$^∘$C
  in temperature and textpm21$μɛ$ in strain has been experimentally achieved over
  a temperature range of 60$^∘$C and strain range of 600$μɛ$.
