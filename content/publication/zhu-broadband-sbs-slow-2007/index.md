abstract: In this paper, we investigate slow light via stimulated Brillouin scattering
  (SBS) in a room temperature  optical fiber that is pumped by a spectrally broadened
  laser. Broadening the spectrum of the pump field increases  the linewidth &#x0394;&#x03C9;P
  of the Stokes amplifying  resonance, thereby increasing the slow-light bandwidth.
  One physical bandwidth limitation occurs when the linewidth  becomes several times
  larger than the Brillouin frequency shift &#x03A9;B so that the anti-Stokes absorbing
  resonance substantially cancels out the Stokes amplifying resonance  and, hence,
  the slow-light effect. We find that partial overlap of the Stokes and anti-Stokes
  resonances can  actually lead to an enhancement of the slow-light delay-bandwidth
  product when &#x0394;&#x03C9;P ~ or = 1.3 &#x03A9;B. Using this general approach,
  we increase the Brillouin  slow-light bandwidth to over 12 GHz from its nominal
  linewidth of ~30 MHz obtained for monochromatic pumping. We controllably delay 75-ps-long
  pulses by up to 47 ps and  study the data-pattern dependence of the broadband SBS
  slow-light system.
