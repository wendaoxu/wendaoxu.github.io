abstract: A convenient method using a commercially available ruled grating for precise
  and overall diameter measurement of optical nanofibers (ONFs) is presented. We form
  a composite Bragg reflector with a micronscale period by dissolving aluminum coating,
  slicing the grating along ruling lines, and mounting it on an ONF. The resonant
  wavelengths of high-order Bragg reflections possess fiber diameter dependence, enabling
  nondestructive measurement of the ONF diameter profile. This method provides an
  easy and economic diagnostic tool for wide varieties of ONF-based applications.
