 abstract = {We investigate optomechanical interactions in anti-resonant hollow-core fibers, for the first time. Experiments and corresponding theoretical calculations reveal weak optomechanical coupling, which suggests that anti-resonant hollow-core fibers are well-suited for noise-sensitive applications.},
