  abstract = {Supercontinuum (SC) generation based on ultrashort pulse compression constitutes one of the most promising technologies towards an ultra-wide bandwidth, high-brightness and spatially coherent light sources for applications such as spectroscopy and microscopy. Here, multi-octave SC generation in a gas-filled hollow-core antiresonant fiber (HC-ARF) is reported spanning from 200 nm in the deep ultraviolet (DUV) to 4000 nm in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). A measured average output power of 5 mW was obtained by pumping at the center wavelength of the first anti-resonance transmission window (2460 nm) with {\textasciitilde}100 fs pulses and an injected pulse energy of {\textasciitilde}7-8 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}J. The mechanism behind the extreme spectral broadening relies upon intense soliton-plasma nonlinear dynamics which leads to efficient soliton self-compression and phase-matched dispersive wave (DW) emission in the DUV region. The strongest DW is observed at 275 nm having an estimated pulse energy of 1.42 \{{\textbackslash}mu\}J, corresponding to 28.4 \% of the total output energy. Furthermore, the effect of changing the pump pulse energy and gas pressure on the nonlinear dynamics and their direct impact on SC generation was investigated. The current work paves a new way towards novel investigations of gas-based ultrafast nonlinear optics in the emerging mid-IR spectral regime.},

Using this more accurate index profile in our C++ full-vectorial finite-difference mode solver, we numerically studied this fiber's modal dispersion, along with the intensity profile, group index spectrum, and group-velocity dispersion spectrum of its fundamental mode. Comparisons between these predictions and their experimental counterparts measured in the fiber show good quantitative agreement for all these characteristics. On the other hand, when these structural deformations are purposely not included in the permittivity profile, the predicted and measured characteristics generally poorly match. The study demonstrates that first, accurate simultaneous predictions of several key modal characteristics of hollow-core fibers can be obtained numerically, and that although small, the aforementioned index-profile perturbations must be included in order to obtain sufficient accuracy.},

Confinement loss and sensitivity are examined and compared with varying number of rings, core diameter, diameter of air holes in cladding ring and pitch. It is found that sensitivity is increased for the increment pitch value, air filling ratio, core diameter, inner ring diameter as well as number of rings. At the same time confinement loss is significantly decreased. It is also found that the increment of pitch by keeping the same air filling ratio increases the sensitivity and loss. Investigating the effects of different parameters, an O-PCF structure is designed which has a significantly higher relative sensitivity and lower confinement loss.},

  abstract = {Heat handling has been a significant problem of the high power fiber laser systems as the output power increases rapidly. Cladding power stripper (CPS) which is used to deal with the unwanted optical power and light is required for higher cooling ability. So the methods of stripping the unwanted light attracted much attention recently, and the thermal effect is given. However, few investigations focus on the dissipation of the heat converted from the unwanted light. In this paper, an approach of active cooling for CPS is demonstrated. This is achieved by using microchannel cooling technology in heat sinking in CPS to improve the efficiency of heat exchange. In order to explain the mechanism of CPS the function of it and consistence of categories of the unwanted light are detailed firstly. Then microchannel heat sinking is proposed and verified by the heat exchange theory. At last, the design of the CPS with microchannel heat sinking is shown and following experiment is conducted. The final temperature of the device with 1000~W cladding power was demonstrated at last to verify the ability of heat distribution of the CPS component. This suggests that these CPSs can be used to stripe a thousand of watts of light in high power double cladding fiber lasers.},

Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

Soft metals are utilized to fabricate a high-power cladding light stripper (CLS).

The experiments show that these metals have the right features for stripping the unwanted light out of the cladding. We also find that the metal\&\#x2013;cladding contact area is of great importance because it determines the attenuation and the thermal load on the CLS.

They are generated by shining laser pulses into optical cavities that contain a nonlinear medium driven by a coherent field (holding beam). The ability to switch cavity solitons on and off1,2 and to control their location and motion3 by applying laser pulses makes them interesting as potential `pixels' for reconfigurable arrays or all-optical processing units. Theoretical work on cavity solitons2,3,4,5,6,7 has stimulated a variety of experiments in macroscopic cavities8,9,10 and in systems with optical feedback11,12,13. But for practical devices, it is desirable to generate cavity solitons in semiconductor structures, which would allow fast response and miniaturization. The existence of cavity solitons in semiconductor microcavities has been predicted theoretically14,15,16,17, and precursors of cavity solitons have been observed, but clear experimental realization has been hindered by boundary-dependence of the resulting optical patterns18,19---cavity solitons should be self-confined. Here we demonstrate the generation of cavity solitons in vertical cavity semiconductor microresonators that are electrically pumped above transparency but slightly below lasing threshold20. We show that the generated optical spots can be written, erased and manipulated as objects independent of each other and of the boundary. Numerical simulations allow for a clearer interpretation of experimental results.},

Forward stimulated Brillouin scattering, in particular, is widely investigated in optical fibres and photonic integrated circuits. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of forward stimulated Brillouin scattering over standard, panda-type polarization maintaining fibres. We distinguish between intra-polarization scattering, in which two pump tones are co-polarized along one principal axis, and inter-polarization processes driven by orthogonally polarized pump waves. Both processes are quantified in analysis, calculations and experiment. Inter-modal scattering, in particular, introduces cross-polarization switching of probe waves that is non-reciprocal. Switching takes place in multiple wavelength windows. The results provide a first demonstration of opto-mechanical non-reciprocity of forward scatter in standard fibre. The inter-polarization process is applicable to distributed sensors of media outside the cladding and coating boundaries, where light cannot reach. The process may be scaled towards forward Brillouin lasers, optical isolators and circulators and narrowband microwave-photonic filters over longer sections of off-the-shelf polarization maintaining fibres.},

Consequently, distributed fibre sensors are restricted to the measurement of conditions that prevail within the core. This work presents distributed analysis of media outside unmodified, standard fibre. Measurements are based on stimulated scattering by guided acoustic modes, which allow us to listen where we cannot look. The protocol overcomes a major difficulty: guided acoustic waves induce forward scattering, which cannot be mapped using time-of-flight. The solution relies on mapping the Rayleigh backscatter contributions of two optical tones, which are coupled by the acoustic wave. Analysis is demonstrated over 3\,km of fibre with 100\,m resolution. Measurements distinguish between air, ethanol and water outside the cladding, and between air and water outside polyimide-coated fibres. The results establish a new sensor configuration: optomechanical time-domain reflectometry, with several potential applications.},

  abstract = {Brillouin scattering in optical fibres is a fundamental interaction between light and sound with important implications ranging from optical sensors to slow and fast light. In usual optical fibres, light both excites and feels shear and longitudinal bulk elastic waves, giving rise to forward-guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering and backward-stimulated Brillouin scattering. In a subwavelength-diameter optical fibre, the situation changes dramatically, as we here report with the first experimental observation of Brillouin light scattering from surface acoustic waves. These Rayleigh-type surface waves travel the wire surface at a specific velocity of 3,400\,m\,s-1 and backscatter the light with a Doppler shift of about 6\,GHz. As these acoustic resonances are sensitive to surface defects or features, surface acoustic wave Brillouin scattering opens new opportunities for various sensing applications, but also in other domains such as microwave photonics and nonlinear plasmonics.},

The Brillouin interaction of a triad of square pump pulses with a continuous signal is described, covering a wide range of pumping schemes. The model predicts how the acoustic wave, the signal amplitude and the optical gain spectral profile depend upon the pumping scheme. Sub-meter spatial resolution is demonstrated for bright-, dark- and {$\pi$}-shifted interrogating pump pulses, together with disturbing echo effects, and the results compare favorably with experimental data. This analytic solution is an excellent tool not only for optimizing the pumping scheme but also for post-processing the measured data to remove resolution degrading features.},

An interferometric-optical-profiling microscope system was used to obtain high-accuracy surface profiles of magnetic media, rapidly and without physical contact with the sample. The profilometer consists of a conventional, reflection-type optical microscope with a Mirau two-beam interferometer attachment. The interference patterns of the surface can be observed through the eyepieces and can be detected with a solid-state linear array of 1024 detector elements. By translating the reference surface of the interferometer with a piezoelectric transducer while taking consecutive measurements, accurate surface-height measurements can be obtained from each detector element. The microscope system is controlled by a microcomputer, which communicates with a desk-top computer for further analysis of the surface-profile data. A computer-controlled specimen stage is added to increase the sample size. The reasons for selecting the Mirau two-beam interferometry are also discussed. Sample data of magnetic tapes are presented. Experimental data presented in the paper show that optimization of surface roughness is necessary to obtain optimum magnetic amplitude, friction, and wear properties.},

The comb filter is based on a fiber loop mirror (FLM) with three sections of high-birefringence (HB) fibers and polarization controllers (PCs). The transmission characteristics of the birefringent FLM are dependent of the relative phase difference of the two orthogonal polarization modes and the rotational angles of the different HB fibers. By adjusting the PCs, four different wavelength spacings can be obtained; particularly, interleaving operation---halved and quartered wavelength spacing---can be effectively realized. By using a Jones matrix method, the transmission of the birefringent comb filter is analyzed. The theoretical analysis agrees with the experimental results. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As a complimentary platform to silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and III-V photonics, Si3N4 waveguide technology opens up a new generation of system-on-chip applications not achievable with the other platforms alone. The availability of low-loss waveguides ({$<$};1 dB/m) that can handle high optical power can be engineered for linear and nonlinear optical functions, and that support a variety of passive and active building blocks opens new avenues for system-on-chip implementations. As signal bandwidth and data rates continue to increase, the optical circuit functions and complexity made possible with Si3N4 has expanded the practical application of optical signal processing functions that can reduce energy consumption, size and cost over today's digital electronic solutions. Researchers have been able to push the performance photonic-integrated components beyond other integrated platforms, including ultrahigh Q resonators, optical filters, highly coherent lasers, optical signal processing circuits, nonlinear optical devices, frequency comb generators, and biophotonic system-on-chip.

Theory is compared to quantitative measurements. Finally, several of the more promising applications of silicon ring resonators are discussed: filters and optical delay lines, label-free biosensors, and active rings for efficient modulators and even light sources.},

SBS has recently been studied extensively in integrated waveguides; however, many implementations rely on complicated fabrication schemes. The absence of SBS in standard and mature fabrication platforms prevents its large-scale circuit integration. Notably, SBS in the emerging silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integration platform is currently out of reach because of the lack of acoustic guidance. Here, we demonstrate advanced control of backward SBS in multilayer Si3N4 waveguides. By optimizing the separation between two Si3N4 layers, we unlock acoustic waveguiding in this platform, potentially leading up to 15{\texttimes} higher Brillouin gain coefficient than previously possible in Si3N4 waveguides. We use the enhanced SBS gain to demonstrate a high-rejection microwave photonic notch filter. This demonstration opens a path to achieving Brillouin-based photonic circuits in a standard, low-loss Si3N4 platform.},

Wide adoption of such technologies however, would need a balance of strong Brillouin interaction and low optical loss in a structure compatible with large scale fabrication. Achieving these characteristics in scalable platforms such as silicon and silicon nitride remains a challenge. Here, we investigate a scalable Brillouin platform combining low loss Si\$\_3\$N\$\_4\$ and tellurium oxide (TeO\$\_2\$) exhibiting strong Brillouin response and enhanced acoustic confinement. In this platform we measure a Brillouin gain coefficient of 8.5{\textasciitilde}m\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$W\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, exhibiting a twenty fold improvement over the largest previously reported Brillouin gain in a Si\$\_3\$N\$\_4\$ platform. Further, we demonstrate cladding engineering to control the strength of the Brillouin interaction. We utilized the Brillouin gain and loss resonances in this waveguide for an RF photonic filter with more than 15 dB rejection and 250 MHz linewidth. Finally, we present a pathway by geometric optimization and cladding engineering to a further enhancement of the gain coefficient to 155{\textasciitilde}m\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$W\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, a potential 400 times increase in the Brillouin gain coefficient.},

  abstract = {A Twist on the Capacity Crunch The rate at which data can be transmitted down optic fibers is approaching a limit because of nonlinear optical effects. Multiplexing allows data to be encoded in different modes of light such as polarization, wavelength, amplitude, and phase and to be sent down the fibers in parallel. Optical angular momentum (OAM) can provide another degree of freedom whereby the photons are given a well-defined twist or helicity. Bozinovic et al. (p. 1545) were able to transmit high-bandwidth data using OAM modes in long lengths of optical fibers, thus providing a possible route to get yet more capacity through optic fiber networks. Internet data traffic capacity is rapidly reaching limits imposed by optical fiber nonlinear effects. Having almost exhausted available degrees of freedom to orthogonally multiplex data, the possibility is now being explored of using spatial modes of fibers to enhance data capacity. We demonstrate the viability of using the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light to create orthogonal, spatially distinct streams of data-transmitting channels that are multiplexed in a single fiber. Over 1.1 kilometers of a specially designed optical fiber that minimizes mode coupling, we achieved 400-gigabits-per-second data transmission using four angular momentum modes at a single wavelength, and 1.6 terabits per second using two OAM modes over 10 wavelengths. These demonstrations suggest that OAM could provide an additional degree of freedom for data multiplexing in future fiber networks. Encoding data in the twist, or helicity, of photons provides a route to increase optical communication rates in fibers.

In fact, material properties in the nanoregime are extremely different from those found in macroscopic samples: few crystalline materials have shown a tensile strength in excess of 10 GPa in the form of nanowires. Still the length of defect-free crystalline nanowires is limited to a few millimeters and the strength of long nanowires is compromised by defects. The strength of glass nanowires is less affected by single defects. In this paper we present the ultimate strength of glass silica nanowires manufactured by a top-down fabrication technique; this is the highest value reported for glass materials. The measured ultimate strength is in excess of 10 GPa and increases for decreasing nanowire diameters. Scanning electron micrographs of the broken fragments showed a fragile rupture.},

The photodiode array samples intensities over a 32 {\texttimes} 32 matrix in the interference pattern as the length of the reference arm is varied piezoelectrically. Using these data the minicomputer synchronously detects the phase at each of the 1024 points by a Fourier series method and displays the wavefront in contour and perspective plot on a storage oscilloscope in less than 1 min (Bruning et al. Paper WE16, OSA Annual Meeting, Oct. 1972). The array of intensities is sampled and averaged many times in a random fashion so that the effects of air turbulence, vibrations, and thermal drifts are minimized. Very significant is the fact that wavefront errors in the interferometer are easily determined and may be automatically subtracted from current or subsequent wavefrots. Various programs supporting the measurement system include software for determining the aperture boundary, sum and difference of wavefronts, removal or insertion of tilt and focus errors, and routines for spatial manipulation of wavefronts. FFT programs transform wavefront data into point spread function and modulus and phase of the optical transfer function of lenses. Display programs plot these functions in contour and perspective. The system has been designed to optimize the collection of data to give higher than usual accuracy in measuring the individual elements and final performance of assembled diffraction limited optical systems, and furthermore, the short loop time of a few minutes makes the system an attractive alternative to constraints imposed by test glasses in the optical shop.},

Here, we report continuous-wave (CW) pumped self-oscillations of a fiber nanostructure that is only mechanically resonant. Since the mechanism has close similarities to stimulated Raman scattering by molecules, it has been named stimulated Raman-like scattering. The structure consists of two submicrometer thick glass membranes (nanowebs), spaced by a few hundred nanometers and supported inside a 12-cm-long capillary fiber. It is driven into oscillation by a CW pump laser at powers as low as a few milliwatts. As the pump power is increased above threshold, a comb of Stokes and anti-Stokes lines is generated, spaced by the oscillator frequency of \&\#x223C;6\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;MHz. An unprecedentedly high Raman-like gain of \&\#x223C;4\&\#xD7;106\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;m\&\#x2212;1\&\#x2009;W\&\#x2212;1 is inferred after analysis of the experimental data.

It comprises two closely spaced ultrathin glass membranes (webs) suspended in air and attached to the inner walls of a glass fiber capillary. Light guided in this dual-web structure can exert attractive or repulsive pressure on the webs, causing them to be pushed together or pulled apart. The elastic deflection of the webs is, in turn, coupled to the electromagnetic field distribution and results in a change in the effective refractive index within the fiber. Employing a pump-probe technique in an interferometric setup, optomechanically induced refractive index changes more than 104 times larger than the Kerr effect are detected. Theoretical estimates of the optomechanical nonlinearity agree well with the experimental results.

  abstract = {Silicon nitride (Si3N4) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are of great interest due to their extremely low propagation loss and higher integration capabilities. The number of applications based on the silicon nitride integrated photonics platform continues to grow, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), hybrid neuromorphic and quantum computing. It's potential for CMOS compatibility, as well as advances in heterogeneous integration with silicon-on-insulator, indium phosphate, and lithium niobate on insulator platforms, are leading to an advanced hybrid large-scale PICs. Here, they review key trends in Si3N4 photonic integrated circuit technology and fill an information gap in the field of state-of-the-art devices operating from the visible to the mid-infrared spectrum. A comprehensive overview of its microfabrication process details (deposition, lithography, etching, etc.) is introduced. Finally, the limitations and challenges of silicon nitride photonics performance are pointed out in an ultra-wideband, providing routes and prospects for its future scaling and optimization.},

The design exploits the idea that a chalcogenide rib buried in a silica matrix acts as waveguide for both light and sound, and can also be designed to be multi-moded for both optical and acoustic waves. The enhanced opto-acoustic coupling allows significant isolation (\&gt; 20 dB) within a chip-scale (cm-long) device (\&lt; 10 cm). We also show that the bandwidth of this device can be dramatically increased by tuning the dispersion of the waveguide to match the group velocity between optical modes: we find that 20 dB isolation can be extended over a bandwidth of 25 nm.},

However, only a few specific low-order TAMs participate in the interaction of different optical mode pairs and then contribute to Brillouin gain. Meanwhile, the changes of dominating Brillouin peaks with the nanofiber radius are shown in detail, which further clearly confirms the difference in the gain characteristics of different intra-mode Brillouin gain spectrums. Especially, several obvious maximum and minimum gain values exist at the nanofiber radius of around 0.8 {$\mu$}m. The HOM induced intra-mode FSBS is of great importance for understanding of the phonon--photon interaction in multi-mode waveguides.},

An extraordinary high Brillouin peak value is predicted for the interaction between the HE11 and the high-order optical mode (TE01). The corresponding excited acoustic mode (R11) has the characteristics of the relatively uniform large normalized displacements and the phase velocity less than the shear acoustic velocity of silica, which completely differs from the transverse acoustic mode in the intra-mode FSBS process of the HE11. The Brillouin peak value by the contribution of R11 can reach 260.5 W-1m-1 at a frequency of 0.1905 GHz, which is at least an order of magnitude higher than the maximum peak value in the intra-mode forward Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS). Moreover, for a nanofiber radius of 0.57 to 1 {$\mu$}m, the contribution of R11 is always the most prominent to the BGS.

There is an increasing interest in this subject since, on one hand, emerging broadband wireless access networks and standards spanning from universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) to fixed access picocellular networks and including wireless local area network (WLAN), World Interoperability for Microwave Access, Inc. (WIMAX), local multipoint distribution service (LMDS), etc., require an increase in capacity by reducing the coverage area. An enabling technology to obtain this objective is based on radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems where signal processing is carried at a central office to where signals are carried from inexpensive remote antenna units (RAUs). On the other hand, microwave photonic filters can find applications in specialized fields such as radar and photonic beamsteering of phased-arrayed antennas, where dynamical reconfiguration is an added value. This paper provides a tutorial introduction of this subject to the reader not working directly in the field but interested in getting an overall introduction of the subject and also to the researcher wishing to get a comprehensive background before working on the subject.},

This model extends previously published results relying on the small-signal approximation and infinite extinction ratio at the modulator outputs. In our treatment the output optical powers are calculated through analytical expressions taking into account the modulator electronic driver and directional coupler characteristics. Closed-form expressions, explicitly displaying the dependence of the link output power on the directional coupler transmission coefficients, optical modulation depth, and bias point, are obtained for output optical power, frequency chirp, extinction ratio and static characteristic MZM curves. We also propose an equivalent interferometric representation of each DO-MZM output in terms of virtual dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulators (DD-MZMs) and show that each modulator output has distinct characteristic curves. The model is applied to a photonic-assisted instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) based on frequency-to-power mapping, in which an amplitude comparison function (ACF) is generated by the power fading functions. We have obtained a generalized ACF through which both the frequency and amplitude of the input RF signal can be determined by a search procedure.},

  abstract = {The fabrication restrictions that must be imposed on the geometry of optical waveguides to make them behave as single-mode devices are well known for relatively large waveguides, with shallow etch depth. However, the restrictions for small waveguides (/spl sim/1 /spl mu/m or less in cross section) are not well understood. Furthermore, it is usually a requirement that these waveguides are polarization independent, which further complicates the issues. This paper reports on the simulations of the conditions for both single-mode behavior and polarization independence, for small and deeply etched silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides. The aim is to satisfy both conditions simultaneously. The results show that at larger waveguide widths, waveguide etch depth has little effect on the mode birefringence because the transverse-electric (TE) mode (horizontal-polarized mode) is well confined under the rib region. However, at smaller rib widths, the etch depth has a large influence on birefringence. An approximate equation relating the rib-waveguide width and etch depth to obtain polarization-independent operation is derived. It is possible to achieve single-mode operation at both polarizations while maintaining polarization independence for each of the waveguide heights used in this paper but may be difficult for other dimensions. For example, a 1-/spl mu/m SOI rib waveguide with an etch depth of 0.64 /spl mu/m and rib width of 0.52 /spl mu/m is predicted to exhibit such characteristics.},

The result shows that, multiple Brillouin scattering peaks with the shift range from 20 to 800 MHz are generated in the step-index fibers. With the core diameter changing, the Brillouin scattering frequency shift has no change, but the scattering efficiency is different. In the PCFs with periodic air holes, there are a few dominant peaks. The frequency shifts vary with the core diameter changing. For the core diameter of 11.6 {$\mu$}m, there are three peaks at 327.39, 556.48 and 824.14 MHz, respectively. When the core diameter decreases to 2.32 {$\mu$}m, the frequency shifts of forward Brilloun scattering are 1.619, 2.779 and 4.123 GHz, respectively. The forward Brillouin frequency shifts increase with the core diameter decreasing. The results will be useful for the research on the mechanism of forward Brillouin scattering and have potential applications on the field of nonlinear fiber optics.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of tunneling is a well-known fundamental consequence of quantum mechanics. All particles can in principle tunnel. In particular, both electrons and photons can tunnel through classically forbidden regions of space known as ``barriers''. However, there have been numerous controversies over how long it takes a particle to cross a barrier. Exploiting an analogy between electrons and photons, we suggest an experiment to infer the characteristics of an electron's barrier-traversal time by measuring the time it takes a photon to traverse a similar barrier. Electron tunneling experiments are in general much more difficult to perform than analogous optical ones. With an optical technique one can construct optical barriers on the scale of microns, in contrast to the{\aa}ngstrom-scale barriers required for electron tunneling. Our experiment may help settle the controversies over tunneling times. By means of a newly developed quantum optical technique, we should be able to measure the tunneling times of individual photons with sub-picosecond resolution. In our experiments we are using a two-photon light source, in which a pair of tightly correlated photons is generated by the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Hong, Ou and Mandel have already achieved a sub-picosecond comparison between the arrival times of two such photons at a beam splitter placed at the intersection of their paths. In our geometry, one member of the photon pair tunnels through a barrier, while the other does not. Then coincidence detection of this photon pair constitutes the detection of an individual tunneling event. The particle aspect of photon tunneling can thus be clearly observed. We propose to use the Hong-Ou-Mandel technique to measure the tunneling time. We have chosen for our tunneling barrier two glass prisms placed in close proximity, utilizing the phenomenon of frustrated total internal reflection.},

  abstract = {The standard platform for silicon photonics has been ridge or channel waveguides fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. SOI waveguides are so versatile and the technology built around it is so mature and popular that silicon photonics is almost regarded as synonymous with SOI photonics. However, due to several shortcomings of SOI photonics, novel platforms have been recently emerging. The shortcomings could be categorized into two sets: (a) those due to using silicon as the waveguide core material; and (b) those due to using silicon dioxide as the bottom cladding layer. Several heterogeneous platforms have been developed to address the first set of shortcomings. In such important heterogeneous integrated photonic platforms, the top silicon layer of SOI is typically replaced by a thin film of another optical material with a refractive index higher than the buried oxide (BOX) bottom cladding layer. Silicon is still usually preferred as the substrate of choice, but silicon has no optical functionality. In contrast, the second category of solutions aim at using silicon as the core waveguide material, while resolving issues related to the BOX layer. Particularly, one of the main drawbacks of SOI is that the BOX layer induces high optical loss in the mid-wavelength infrared (mid-IR) range. Accordingly, a host of platforms have been proposed, and some have been demonstrated, in which the BOX is replaced with insulating materials that have low intrinsic loss in the mid-IR. Examples are sapphire, lithium niobate, silicon nitride and air (suspended Si membrane waveguides). Although silicon is still the preferred substrate, sometimes a thin film of silicon, on which the optical waveguide is formed, is directly placed on top of another substrate (e.g., sapphire or lithium niobate). These alternative substrates act as both mechanical support and the lower cladding layer. In addition to the demands of mid-IR photonics, the non-SOI platforms can potentially offer other advantages and flexibilities. Examples are different, and sometimes interesting, guided mode properties (e.g., single-mode and single-polarization behavior), enhanced dispersion engineering (wideband anomalous regimes), as well as ease of fabrication and higher thermal conductivity in some cases. The objective of this article is to review this category of non-SOI photonic platforms that use silicon as the waveguide core layer and discuss their challenges and opportunities.},

The tapered fibres were fabricated with an adiabatic tapering process from graded and step-index fibres with 50{$\mu$}m core diameters to form a 100mm long taper with 5:1 taper ratio. We tested tapered graded-index and step-index fibres fabricated from commercial Thorlabs products and a custom graded-index taper. The 5:1 tapered graded-index fibre can give a transmission greater than 0.4 for Thorlabs and 0.6 for the custom taper. We simulated the transmission of the tapered fibres and found reasonable agreement with the measured graded-index tapered fibre results across the numerical aperture range of interest. Experimentally, step-index tapered fibres performed relative poorly and considerably below modelling expectations. Based on our examinations this arises because the properties of step-index fibre were not robust to the tapering process. Suitably tapered graded-index fibres may offer a new route for efficient focal ratio reduction of fibre optic signals, e.g., in fibre-fed spectrographs, though we stress that our measurements have been limited to monochromatic light in this work.},

  abstract = {Processing of microwave signals using photonics has several key advantages for applications in wireless communications. However, to bring photonic-based microwave signal processing to the mainstream requires a reduction of the form factor. Integration is a route for achieving high-performance, low-cost, and small-footprint microwave photonic devices. A high on-chip stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) gain is essential for synthesizing several key functionalities for advanced integrated microwave signal processing. We have optimized our on-chip SBS platform to achieve a record on-chip gain of 52 dB. In this paper, we discuss the implications of this giant gain from the viewpoint of new enabled technologies. The giant gain can be distributed over wide frequencies, which can be exploited for the realization of reconfigurable microwave bandpass, bandstop, and multiband filters. High gain also enables the demonstration of low-threshold on-chip lasers, which can be of relevance for a low-noise radio-frequency signal generation. These wide ranges of functionalities are made possible by the breakthrough on-chip gain makes Brillouin-based microwave photonic signal processing a promising approach for real-world implementation in the near future.},

  abstract = {The standard single-mode fiber has been demonstrated as an optomechanical sensor recently to measure the acoustic impedances of surrounding liquids by means of the generation and detection of forward-stimulated Brillouin scattering (FSBS). FSBS allows the mechanical properties of an external material to be probed directly through the interaction of guided light and transverse sound waves that occurs entirely inside the fiber structure. In this technique, having a low-loss interface between the fiber bulk and the external medium is essential for precise measurement; however, it leads to the necessary but impractical removal of the thick polymer fiber coating in most reported methods. Here, we use a commercially available 80-{$\mu$}m-diameter optical fiber coated with a 8-{$\mu$}m-thick polyimide coating layer to measure the acoustic impedances of the surrounding liquids, showing accurate measurement results while retaining the mechanical strength of the fiber.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Care management focuses on improving coordination of care and improving health-related behaviors for identified, at-risk populations. There have been relatively few studies of care management interventions that used randomized controlled clinical trial design. These studies have yielded discrepant results. Methods: Randomized controlled studies of asthma care management interventions were identified and summarized. Common themes of beneficial and nonbeneficial programs were identified. Results: The randomized clinical trials that did show benefit targeted low-income, inner-city patients with poorly controlled asthma and incorporated in-person plus telephone visits. Several programs provided services to reduce asthma triggers in the home; programs that did not show benefit targeted populations with relatively high levels of adherence to inhaled corticosteroid and did not provide resources (other than advice) for environmental remediation. One study that failed to show benefit had a fragmented, subcontracted care management process that was not connected to the child's medical home. Innovative programs that showed benefit in randomized studies and deserve replication include use of community health workers for home visits and school-based asthma care management. Conclusions: Asthma care management is beneficial in some, but not all populations. The most benefit was seen in populations with under-treated, poorly controlled asthma. Fragmented, subcontracted care management programs that were not community-based and not connected to the child's medical home were not beneficial. A care management process that involved both in-person visits and telephone follow-up and provision of resources for reduction of asthma triggers in the home were components of successful programs.},

We demonstrate generation and guidance of a three-octave spectral comb, spanning wavelengths from 325 to 2300 nanometers, in a hydrogen-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. The waveguidance results not from a photonic band gap but from the inhibited coupling between the core and cladding modes. The spectrum consists of up to 45 high-order Stokes and anti-Stokes lines and is generated by driving the confined gas with a single, moderately powerful (10-kilowatt) infrared laser, producing 12-nanosecond-duration pulses. This represents a reduction by six orders of magnitude in the required laser powers over previous equivalent techniques and opens up a robust and much simplified route to synthesizing attosecond pulses. A new theory of how photonic-crystal fibers guide light is used to design a hydrogen-filled fiber that emits light from 325 to 2300 nanometers at low input power.

Here, we present a fiber-coupled photonic-crystal waveguide single-photon source relying on evanescent coupling of the light field from a tapered out-coupler to an optical fiber. A two-step approach is taken where the performance of the tapered out-coupler is recorded first on an independent device containing an on-chip reflector. Reflection measurements establish that the chip-to-fiber coupling efficiency exceeds 80 \%. The detailed characterization of a high-efficiency photonic-crystal waveguide extended with a tapered out-coupling section is then performed. The corresponding overall single-photon source efficiency is 10.9 \% \${\textbackslash}backslashpm\$ 2.3 \%, which quantifies the success probability to prepare an exciton in the quantum dot, couple it out as a photon in the waveguide, and subsequently transfer it to the fiber. The applied out-coupling method is robust, stable over time, and broadband over several tens of nanometers, which makes it a highly promising pathway to increase the efficiency and reliability of planar chip-based single-photon sources.}

The phononic defect is carefully designed to confine the transversally resonating breathing acoustic mode inside the phononic band gap of the host phononic crystal. These breathing acoustic modes are well excited by the fundamental optical modes of the waveguides. By optimizing this structure, we show the possibility of achieving high SBS gain in an integrated platform with full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility with other photonic and electronic functionalities.

  abstract = {Optical frequency combs1,2,3 provide equidistant frequency markers in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet4,5, and can be used to link an unknown optical frequency to a radio or microwave frequency reference6,7. Since their inception, frequency combs have triggered substantial advances in optical frequency metrology and precision measurements6,7 and in applications such as broadband laser-based gas sensing8 and molecular fingerprinting9. Early work generated frequency combs by intra-cavity phase modulation10,11; subsequently, frequency combs have been generated using the comb-like mode structure of mode-locked lasers, whose repetition rate and carrier envelope phase can be stabilized12. Here we report a substantially different approach to comb generation, in which equally spaced frequency markers are produced by the interaction between a continuous-wave pump laser of a known frequency with the modes of a monolithic ultra-high-Q microresonator13 via the Kerr nonlinearity14,15. The intrinsically broadband nature of parametric gain makes it possible to generate discrete comb modes over a 500-nm-wide span ({$\sim$}70 THz) around 1,550 nm without relying on any external spectral broadening. Optical-heterodyne-based measurements reveal that cascaded parametric interactions give rise to an optical frequency comb, overcoming passive cavity dispersion. The uniformity of the mode spacing has been verified to within a relative experimental precision of 7.3 {\texttimes} 10-18. In contrast to femtosecond mode-locked lasers16, this work represents a step towards a monolithic optical frequency comb generator, allowing considerable reduction in size, complexity and power consumption. Moreover, the approach can operate at previously unattainable repetition rates17, exceeding 100 GHz, which are useful in applications where access to individual comb modes is required, such as optical waveform synthesis18, high capacity telecommunications or astrophysical spectrometer calibration19.},

The single sideband performance is compared to double sideband modulation using the same Mach-Zehnder modulator in either a push-pull configuration using a 180{$^\circ$} RF hybrid or a single-arm drive configuration. The optical sideband powers, RF output power and the output intercept power and spur-free dynamic range of the third-order intermodulation nonlinearity are compared both theoretically and experimentally for each of the three cases.

  abstract = {The analysis of surrounding media has been a long-standing challenge of optical fiber sensors. Measurements are difficult due to the confinement of light to the inner core of standard fibers. Over the last two years, new sensor concepts have enabled the analysis of liquids outside the cladding boundary, where light does not reach. Sensing is based on opto-mechanical, forward stimulated Brillouin scattering (F-SBS) interactions between guided light and sound waves. In most previous studies, however, the protective polymer coating of the fiber had to be removed first. In this work, we report the opto-mechanical analysis of liquids outside commercially available, standard single-mode fibers with polyimide coating. The polyimide layer provides mechanical protection but can also transmit acoustic waves from the fiber cladding toward outside media. The comprehensive analysis of opto-mechanical coupling in coated fibers that are immersed in liquid is provided. The model shows that F-SBS spectra in coated fibers are more complex than those of bare fibers and strongly depend on the exact coating diameter and the choice of acoustic mode. Nevertheless, sensing outside coated fibers is demonstrated experimentally. Integrated measurements over 100 m of fiber clearly distinguish between air, ethanol, and water outside polyimide coating. Measured spectra are in close quantitative agreement with the analytic predictions. Furthermore, distributed opto-mechanical time-domain reflectometry mapping of water and ethanol outside coated fiber is reported, with a spatial resolution of 100 m. The results represent a large step toward practical opto-mechanical fiber sensors.},

The elastic parameters of polymer coatings can be studied through off-line analysis of test samples. However, the monitoring of these properties on a working fiber during service is challenging. In this work, we use forward stimulated Brillouin scattering processes in standard single mode fibers to measure the acoustic velocity in several types of coating layers. Pump light launches short acoustic pulses outward from the core of the fiber. Multiple reflections at the boundaries between cladding and coating, and between coating and air, form a series of delayed acoustic echoes across the core. These echoes are monitored, in turn, by photo-elastic phase modulation of probe light. Data are collected at temperatures between 25--120 {$^\circ$}C. The thermal dependence of the acoustic velocities in several coatings and of the F-SBS resonance frequencies is investigated. Observations are corroborated by calculations. The proposed technique is well suited for research and development of coating materials, production line quality control, reliability studies and preventive maintenance of working fibers.},

  abstract = {Optical fibers containing multiple cores are widely regarded as the leading solution to the optical communications capacity crunch. The most prevalent paradigm for the design and employment of multi-core fibers relies on the suppression of direct coupling of optical power among cores. The cores, however, remain mechanically coupled. Inter-core, opto-mechanical cross-talk, among cores that are otherwise optically isolated from one another, is shown in this work for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Light in one core stimulates guided acoustic modes of the entire fiber cladding. These modes, in turn, induce refractive index perturbations that extend across to other cores. Unlike corresponding processes in standard fiber, light waves in off-axis cores stimulate general torsional--radial guided acoustic modes of the cylindrical cross section. Hundreds of such modes give rise to inter-core cross-phase modulation, with broad spectra that are quasi-continuous up to 1 GHz frequency. Inter-core cross-talk in a commercial, seven-core fiber is studied in both analysis and experiment. Opto-mechanical cross-talk is quantified in terms of an equivalent nonlinear coefficient, per acoustic mode or per frequency. The nonlinear coefficient may reach 1.9[W\&\#x00D7;km]\&\#x2212;1, a value that is comparable with that of the intra-core Kerr effect in the same fiber.},

The triply resonant Stimulated Brillouin scattering process underlying the Brillouin-scattering-induced transparency greatly enhances the light--acoustic interaction, enabling the storage of light as a coherent, circulating acoustic wave with a lifetime up to 10\,{$\mu$}s. Furthermore, because of the phase-matching requirement, a circulating acoustic wave can only couple to light with a given propagation direction, leading to non-reciprocal light storage and retrieval.

Ultra-compact optical devices in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates serve compatibility with semiconductor fabrication technology leading to reduction of cost and mass production. Photonic crystal structures possess immense potential for realizing various compact optical devices. However, coupling light to photonic crystal waveguide structures is crucial in order to achieve strong transmission and wider bandwidth of signal. Widening of bandwidth will increase potential for various applications and high transmission will make easy signal detection at the output. In this paper, the techniques reported so far for coupling light in photonic crystal waveguides have been reviewed and analyzed so that a comprehensive guide for an efficient coupling to photonic crystal waveguides can be made possible.},

Here, we demonstrate resonant driving of torsional mechanical modes of a single-mode tapered optical nanofiber using spin angular momentum. The nanofiber torsional mode spectrum is characterized by polarimetry, showing narrow natural resonances (Q\&\#x2248;2,000). By sending amplitude-modulated light through the nanofiber, we resonantly drive individual torsional modes as a function of the light polarization. By varying the input polarization to the fiber, we find the largest amplification of a mechanical oscillation (\&gt;35\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;dB) is observed when driving the system with light containing longitudinal spin on the nanofiber waist.

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the design of few-mode fibers (FMFs) guiding 2 to 12 linearly polarized (LP) modes with low differential mode delay (DMD) over the C-band, suitable for long-haul transmission. Two different types of refractive index profile have been considered: a graded-core with a cladding trench (GCCT) profile and a multi-step-index (MSI) profile. The profiles parameters are optimized in order to achieve: the lowest possible DMD and macro-bend losses (MBL) lower than the ITU-T standard recommendation. The optimization results show that the MSI profiles present lower DMD than the minimum achieved with a GCCT profile. Moreover, it is shown that the optimum DMD and the MBL scale with the number of modes for both profiles. The optimum DMD obtained for 12 LP modes is lower than 3 ps/km using a GCCT profile and lower than 2.5 ps/km using a MSI profile. The optimization results reveal that the most preponderant parameter of the GCCT profile is the refractive index relative difference at the core center, {$\Delta$}nco. Reducing {$\Delta$}nco, the DMD is reduced at the expense of increasing the MBL. Regarding the MSI profiles, it is shown that 64 steps are required to obtain a DMD improvement considering 12 LP modes. Finally, the impact of the fabrication margins on the optimum DMD is analyzed. The probability of having a manufactured FMF with 12 LP modes and DMD lower than 12 ps/km is approximately 68\% using a GCCT profile and 16\% using a MSI profile.},

  abstract = {It is now commonly accepted that, in large pitch hollow-core `kagom{\'e}' lattice fibers, the loss spectrum is related to resonances of the thin silica webs in the photonic crystal cladding. Moreover, coherent scattering from successive holes' layers cannot be obtained and adding holes' layers does not decrease the loss level. In this communication, cross-comparison of experimental data and accurate numerical modeling is presented that helps demonstrate that waveguiding in large pitch hollow-core fibers arises from the antiresonance of the core surround only and does not originate from the photonic crystal cladding. The glass webs only mechanically support the core surround and are sources of extra leakage. Large pitch hollow-core fibers exhibit features of thin walled and thick walled tubular waveguides, the first one tailoring the transmission spectrum while the second one is responsible for the increased loss figure. As a consequence, an approximate calculus, based on specific features of both types of waveguides, gives the loss spectrum, in very good agreement with experimental data. Finally, a minimalist hollow-core microstructured fiber, the cladding of which consists of six thin bridges suspending the core surround, is proposed for the first time.},

In this way the optical properties of a medium can be dramatically modified, leading to electromagnetically induced transparency and related effects, which have placed gas-phase systems at the center of recent advances in the development of media with radically new optical properties. This article reviews these advances and the new possibilities they offer for nonlinear optics and quantum information science. As a basis for the theory of electromagnetically induced transparency the authors consider the atomic dynamics and the optical response of the medium to a continuous-wave laser. They then discuss pulse propagation and the adiabatic evolution of field-coupled states and show how coherently prepared media can be used to improve frequency conversion in nonlinear optical mixing experiments. The extension of these concepts to very weak optical fields in the few-photon limit is then examined. The review concludes with a discussion of future prospects and potential new applications.},

Besides the small optical mode volume, two physical mechanisms come into play simultaneously: a volume effect caused by the strain-induced refractive index perturbation (known as photo-elasticity), and a surface effect caused by the shift of the optical boundaries due to mechanical vibrations. As a result, proper material and structure engineering allows one to control each contribution individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the perfect cancellation of Brillouin scattering arising from Rayleigh acoustic waves by engineering a silica nanowire with exactly opposing photo-elastic and moving-boundary effects. This demonstration provides clear experimental evidence that the interplay between the two mechanisms is a promising tool to precisely control the photon--phonon interaction, enhancing or suppressing it.},

Spectral filter is an essential part of any communication systems, and in the case of multiband wireless communications, tunable multiband RF filters are required for channel selection, noise/interference removal, and RF signal processing. Unfortunately, it is difficult for RF electronics to achieve both tunable and multiband spectral filtering. Recent advancements of microwave photonics have proven itself to be a promising candidate to solve various challenges in RF electronics including spectral filtering, however, the development of multiband microwave photonic filtering still faces lots of difficulties, due to the limited scalability and tunability of existing microwave photonic schemes. In this review paper, we first discuss the challenges that were facing by multiband microwave photonic filter, then we review recent techniques that have been developed to tackle the challenge and lead to promising developments of tunable microwave photonic multiband filters. The successful design and implementation of tunable microwave photonic multiband filter facilitate the vision of dynamic multiband wireless communications and radio frequency signal processing for commercial, defense, and civilian applications.},

Here, a variation of OBM that allows single-exposure operation with wavelength multiplexing and image splitting with a Wollaston prism is introduced. Asymmetric anamorphic distortion induced by the prism is characterized and corrected in real time using a graphics-processing unit. To demonstrate the capacity of single-exposure OBM to perform artifact-free imaging of blood flow, video-rate movies of microcirculation in ovo in the chorioallantoic membrane of the developing chick are presented.

A Laguerre--Gaussian beam is created in free space using a spatial light modulator (SLM) and coupled to a few-mode fiber. This device allows convenient switching between the fundamental and LP11 fiber modes. By selecting a few-mode fiber with a relatively low cladding-core ratio, the propagation of the LP11 mode down to a submicron waist has been maintained. Furthermore, by observing the transmission profile during tapering, it is possible to decisively terminate the pulling process in order to eliminate the two degenerate HE21 modes of the LP11 mode. As a result, a nanofiber can be fabricated through which only the TE01 and TM01 components of the LP11 mode propagate. Such a nanofiber has promising applications in the area of mode interference for controlled particle trapping sites.},

  abstract = {Filtering antennas or filtennas realize both antennas and filter functions in a single structure with the sole purpose of reducing losses and size in the design of a radio system. This article presents a comprehensive view of various filtennas design techniques and their types, satisfying the requirements of different wireless communication standards. The codesign and synthesis approaches and multilayer structure, slot/slit, and parasitic elements are the frequently used techniques reported in the literature to date for the filtennas design. The codesign and synthesis approaches need an extra filter in the filtenna's design, thus making it more complex. Whereas multilayer, slot, and parasitic elements do not require additional filters, and help the radio design become compact in size. The individual elements, that is, filter and antenna used in the filtenna are designed by cutting slots, stacking, resonators, or metamaterial structures. There are two broad categories of filtennas, namely, planar and nonplanar. Most of the papers covered in this article are planar, whereas, under the nonplanar category, horn filtennas are analyzed. Performance in each case is compared in terms of size, complexity, and cost. Considering filtennas frequency of operation, they are classified as a single band, multiband, ultra-wideband, and their MIMO configurations are analyzed to improve the reliability of the wireless radio system. Finally, various types of filtennas are compared, and the design guidelines are elaborated, mainly focusing on their application aspect to achieve more compact radio design solutions. The different techniques related to designing filtennas have been compared, and their glance details are provided for a more realistic assessment of individual techniques used till date. Thus, the authors believe that this review article presents a helpful guiding platform for researchers working on filtenna design.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear coefficient of chalcogenide glass is 200--1000 times larger than that of silica glass, and it is transparent in the 1--15~{$\mu$}m wavelength windows, which makes the nonlinear effects happen at much low power with a short length in near- and mid-infrared wavelength window. With tapered chalcogenide fibers, the power density in the core and the waveguide nonlinearity can be enhanced to make nonlinear signal processing unit at a compact size. The threshold of Raman scattering and supercontinuum generation is reduced due to the enhanced Kerr effect and enhanced optical power intensity. Phase-matching condition required in four-wave mixing (FWM) can be realized by tailoring fiber structures to engineer the chromatic dispersion, which enables new wavelengths creation over a large range at mW power and sub-meter length. The guided acoustic waves and longitudinal acoustic waves can be generated and detected in mW power with chalcogenide tapers. The high power density in the microwires and the high photosensitivity of chalcogenide glass in the 1550~nm band enable the inscription of FBGs in the fiber directly. The chalcogenide microwires are fragile and the core diameter cannot be tapered down to sub-microns, which can be mitigated by polymer coating that can provide mechanical strength. Polymers not only provide high mechanical strength as the coating and cladding materials but also bring over 10 times larger thermal expansion than chalcogenide cores, which enhances the sensor prospect of the chalcogenide fibers for temperature, strain, and acoustic sensing. This work reviews the present and emerging trends in investigation of chalcogenide tapers, mainly focusing on the fabrication procedure of chalcogenide microwires, the nonlinear effects, and sensing applications.},

However, many applications also require narrow-band \$({\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}text\{MHz\})\$ filtering operations that are challenging to implement using optical filtering techniques, as this requires reliable integration of ultra-high quality factor \$({\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}8)\$ optical resonators. One way to address this challenge is to utilize long-lived acoustic resonances, taking advantage of their narrow-band frequency response to filter microwave signals. In this paper, we examine new strategies to harness a narrow-band acoustic response within a microwave-photonic signal processing platform through use of light-sound coupling. Our signal processing scheme is based on a recently demonstrated photon-phonon emitter-receiver device, which transfers information between the optical and acoustic domains using Brillouin interactions, and produces narrow-band filtering of a microwave signal. To understand the best way to use this device technology, we study the properties of a microwave-photonic link using this filtering scheme. We theoretically analyze the noise characteristics of this microwave-photonic link, and explore the parameter space for the design and optimization of such systems.},

  abstract = {In most practical scenarios, optical susceptibilities can be treated as a local property of a medium. For example, in the context of nonlinear optics we can typically treat the Kerr and Raman response as local, such that optical fields at one location do not produce a nonlinear response at distinct locations in space. This is because the electronic and vibrational disturbances produced within the material are confined to a region that is smaller than an optical wavelength. By comparison, Brillouin interactions, mediated by traveling-wave acoustic phonons, can result in a highly nonlocal nonlinear response as the elastic waves generated in the process can occupy a region in space much larger than an optical wavelength. The unique properties of these interactions can be exploited to engineer new types of processes, where highly delocalized phonon modes serve as an engineerable channel that mediates scattering processes between light waves propagating in distinct optical waveguides. These types of nonlocal optomechanical responses have recently been demonstrated as the basis for information transduction, however the nontrivial dynamics of such systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we show that the third-order nonlinear process resulting from spatially extended Brillouin-active phonon modes involves mixing products from spatially separated, optically decoupled waveguides, yielding a nonlocal susceptibility. Building on these concepts, we illustrate how nontrivial multi-mode acoustic interference can produce a nonlocal susceptibility with a multi-pole frequency response, as the basis for new optical and microwave signal processing schemes within traveling wave systems.},

Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Bose--Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms.

The power-handling capability of the device is tested up to cladding light of power up to 150 W.

The effect of intermodal four-wave mixing (IMFWM) and intramodal FWM for waves with different spatial modes (LP01, LP02, LP11, and LP12) over MMF has been analyzed with the help of an optical spectrum analyzer using VPI Photonics/VPI transmission Makerâ¢ version 9.7 simulator. It can be concluded that high launch power and low dispersion generated sidebands in the cases of both intermodal and intramodal FWM. These FWM products grow in number with variation in wavelength of probe as well as these products grow toward the central pump frequency of that particular mode. It mathematically represents the multimode nonlinear propagation of different mode groups (containing N spatial modes in each group) in MMF due to Kerr effect. Thus, nonlinear interaction between modes results in interference that degrades the performance of multichannel mode-division multiplexed systems. To achieve full-phase matching and reduce the effect of IMFWM, chromatic dispersion has been increased in each spatial mode throughout the link.},

While previously demonstrated applications relied exclusively on the low-loss transmission of only the fundamental mode, the implementation of multimode tapers that adiabatically transmit several modes has remained very challenging, hindering their use in various emerging applications in multimode nonlinear optics and quantum optics. Here, we report the realization of multimode submicron tapers that permit the simultaneous adiabatic transmission of multiple higher-order modes including the LP02 mode, through introducing deep wet-etching of conventional fiber before fiber tapering. Furthermore, as a critical application, we demonstrate fundamental-to-fundamental all-fiber third-harmonic generation with high conversion efficiencies. Our work paves the way for ultrahigh-efficiency multimode nonlinear and quantum optics, facilitating nonclassical light generation in the multimode regime, multimode soliton interactions and photonic quantum gates, and manipulation of the evanescent-field-induced optical trapping potentials of atoms and nanoparticles.},

The roots of the frequency equations are presented in terms of normalized wave numbers. The normalized wave numbers for the other six sets of end conditions are obtained using the analysis of symmetric and antisymmetric modes.

The SFDR of the MPF is improved due to the gain enhancement by a partial suppression of the optical carrier. An experiment is performed.

Also, optical memories based on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) suffer strongly from such decoherent effects. External magnetic control fields may reduce decoherence and increase EIT storage times considerably but also lead to complicated multilevel structures. These are hard to prepare perfectly in order to push storage times toward the theoretical limit, i.e., the population lifetime T1. We present a self-learning evolutionary strategy to efficiently drive an EIT-based memory. By combination of the self-learning loop for optimized optical preparation and improved dynamical decoupling, we extend EIT storage times in a doped solid above 40 s. Moreover, we demonstrate storage of images by EIT for 1 min. These ultralong storage times set a new benchmark for EIT-based memories. The concepts are also applicable to other storage protocols.},

Nanofibers supporting higher-order modes (HOMs) provide additional degrees of freedom to enable complex evanescent field profiles for interaction with the surrounding medium, but local control of these profiles requires nondestructive evaluation of the propagating fields. Here, we use Rayleigh scattering for rapid measurement of the propagation of light in few-mode ONFs. Imaging the Rayleigh scattered light provides direct visualization of the spatial evolution of propagating fields throughout the entire fiber, including the transition from core\&\#x2013;cladding guidance to cladding\&\#x2013;air guidance. We resolve the interference between HOMs to determine local beat lengths and modal content along the fiber, and show that the modal superposition in the waist can be systematically controlled by adjusting the input superposition. With this diagnostic we can measure variations in the radius of the fiber waist to below 3\&\#xA0;nm in situ using purely optical means. This nondestructive technique also provides useful insight into light propagation in ONFs.},

Our pulling and transfer procedures allow us to fabricate optical nanofibers that transmit more than 400 mW in high vacuum conditions. These results, published as parameters in our previous work, present an improvement of two orders of magnitude less loss for the fundamental mode and an increase in transmission of more than 300\% for higher-order modes, when following the protocols detailed in this paper. We extract from the transmission during the pull, the only reported spectrogram of a fundamental mode launch that does not include excitation to asymmetric modes; in stark contrast to a pull in which our cleaning protocol is not followed. These results depend critically on the pre-pull cleanliness and when properly following our pulling protocols are in excellent agreement with simulations.},

The Brillouin fiber laser ring resonator is cascaded with a PT symmetric system to achieve this MPF. Wherein, the Brillouin laser resonator is excited by a 5 km single mode fiber to generate Brillouin gain, and the PT symmetric system is configured with Polarization Beam Splitter (PBS) and polarization controller (PC) to achieve PT symmetry. Thanks to the significant enhancement of the gain difference between the main mode and the edge mode when the polarization state PT symmetry system breaks, a single mode oscillating Brillouin laser is generated. Through the selective amplification of sideband modulated signals by ultra-narrow linewidth Brillouin single mode laser gain, the MPF with ultra-narrow single passband performance is obtained. By simply tuning the central wavelength of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) pumped laser to adjust the Brillouin oscillation frequency, the gain position of the Brillouin laser can be shifted, thereby achieving flexible tunability. The experimental results indicate that the MPF proposed in this paper achieves a single pass band narrow to 72 Hz and the side mode rejection ratio of more than 18 dB, with a center frequency tuning range of 0--20 GHz in the testing range of vector network analysis, which means that the MPF possesses ultra high spectral resolution and enormous potential application value in the domain of ultra fine microwave spectrum filtering such as radar imaging and electronic countermeasures.},

It exhibits a pressure sensitivity of approximately 0.066 MHz/kPa. This device provides a candidate for gas pressure measurement. We also measure the temperature response of the spectra.

  abstract = {A technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been developed for noninvasive cross-sectional imaging in biological systems. OCT uses low-coherence interferometry to produce a two-dimensional image of optical scattering from internal tissue microstructures in a way that is analogous to ultrasonic pulse-echo imaging. OCT has longitudinal and lateral spatial resolutions of a few micrometers and can detect reflected signals as small as approximately 10(-10) of the incident optical power. Tomographic imaging is demonstrated in vitro in the peripapillary area of the retina and in the coronary artery, two clinically relevant examples that are representative of transparent and turbid media, respectively.},

  abstract = {The theory of elastic vibrations in solid circular cylindrical rods of homogeneous isotropic materials is redeveloped from the general equations of elasticity with the following general results: 1. For any mode of vibration the ratio of the velocity of any elastic wave traveling along the rod to the velocity c0 of shear waves is the same for any two rods whose Poisson ratios are equal and whose ratios of circumference to shear wave-length are equal; 2. If the velocity of propagation for any particular mode remains less than c0 as the frequency or radius is increased indefinitely, this velocity approaches that of Rayleigh surface-waves; 3. If the velocity of propagation for any particular mode remains greater than c0 as the frequency or radius is increased indefinitely, this velocity approaches c0 in the limit; and 4. A considerable simplification is introduced into the method of computing dispersion curves for any mode. This investigation not only generalizes and extends the work of D. Bancroft on elongational waves but further includes the computation of an exact table of dispersion curves for the flexural mode of vibration. The dispersion curves for magnesium are compared with the experimental results of Shear and Focke. Excellent agreement between theory and experiment is obtained for the first elongational and flexural branches.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of microwave filter technology from an applications perspective. Military applications required wide-band and tunable devices for electronic support measures receivers, which led to the development of highly selective wide-band waveguide filters, coaxial resonator and suspended-substrate multiplexers, and electronically tunable filters. The satellite communications industry created demand for low-mass narrow-band low-loss filters with severe specifications on amplitude selectivity and phase linearity. These requirements resulted in the development of dual-mode waveguide and dielectric-resonator filters, and advances in the design of contiguous multiplexers. Cellular communications base-stations demanded low-loss high power-handling selective filters with small physical size, capable of being manufactured in tens of thousands at a reasonable cost. These demands led to advances in coaxial resonator, dielectric resonator, and superconducting filters, and also to methods of cost-reduction, including computer-aided alignment. Cellular radio handsets have required the manufacture of hundreds of millions of extremely small very low-cost filters, still with reasonably low loss and high selectivity. This has driven significant advances in integrated ceramic, surface, and bulk acoustic-wave active filters and filters using micromachined electromechanical systems.},

While the advances demonstrated to date are largely based on electromechanical coupling, a robust and customizable coherent optical coupling would unlock mature and powerful cavity optomechanical control techniques and an efficient optical pathway for long-distance quantum links. Here we demonstrate direct and robust coherent optical coupling to Gaussian surface acoustic wave cavities with small mode volumes and high quality factors ({$>$}105 measured here) through a Brillouin-like optomechanical interaction. High-frequency SAW cavities designed with curved metallic acoustic reflectors deposited on crystalline substrates are efficiently optically accessed along piezo-active directions, as well as non-piezo-active (electromechanically inaccessible) directions. The precise optical technique uniquely enables controlled analysis of dissipation mechanisms as well as detailed transverse spatial mode spectroscopy. These advantages combined with simple fabrication, large power handling, and strong coupling to quantum systems make SAW optomechanical platforms particularly attractive for sensing, material science, and hybrid quantum systems.},

It is critical in a variety of sectors, including cultural relic preservation, warehouse products maintenance, manufacturing process control, semiconductor, agriculture, food production storage, environmental control, health industries, chemical and home improvement. It outperforms its electronic equivalent owing to its capacity to function in tough and demanding situations such as combustible surroundings, greater pressure and temperature levels, and the ability to send signals over long distances without electromagnetic interference. Optical fiber sensors are classified based on their operating principles such as interferometers, fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), resonators and whispering galleries modes (WGM). This paper presents a comprehensive review related to the optical microfiber sensor such as its properties, fabrication techniques, evanescent wave, optical micro resonators and recent study on the application of microfiber towards humidity sensing.

By tuning the pump power and frequency, the proposed technique is fully reconfigurable and viable for a broad range of spectrum sensing. Several experimental illustrations of the time domain sensing are presented for two-tone channels with 0.9, 1.8, and 5\&\#x00A0;GHz frequencies to detect the unused spectrum within 3G, 4G, and 5G signals.},

Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a reconfigurable all-optical isolator based on optical excitation of a gigahertz guided acoustic mode in a micrometre-sized photonic crystal fibre core. This device has remarkable advantages over its passive counterparts, including a large dynamic range of isolation, fast switching capability and reversibility, which provide new functionality that is useful in various types of all-optical systems.

  abstract = {Interactions between light and hypersonic waves can be enhanced by tight field confinement, as shown in periodically structured materials1, microcavities2, micromechanical resonators3 and photonic crystal fibres4,5,6 (PCFs). There are many examples of weak sound--light interactions, for example, guided acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering in conventional optical fibres7. This forward-scattering effect results from the interaction of core-guided light with acoustic resonances of the entire fibre cross-section, and is viewed as a noise source in quantum-optics experiments8. Here, we report the observation of strongly nonlinear forward scattering of laser light by gigahertz acoustic vibrations, tightly trapped together in the small core of a silica--air PCF. Bouncing to and fro across the core at close to 90{$\circ$} to the fibre axis, the acoustic waves form optical-phonon-like modes with a flat dispersion curve and a distinct cutoff frequency {\textohm}a. This ensures automatic phase-matching to the guided optical mode so that, on pumping with a dual-frequency laser source tuned to {\textohm}a, multiple optical side bands are generated, spaced by {\textohm}a. The number of strong side bands in this Raman-like process increases with pump power. The results point to a new class of designable nonlinear optical device with applications in, for example, pulse synthesis, frequency comb generation for telecommunications and fibre laser mode-locking.},

It can be, therefore, concluded that adiabatic tapering is a powerful method for selective excitation of the fundamental mode in highly multimode large-mode-area fibers. Annular near field distortion observed for large output core diameters was attributed to built-in stress due to thermal expansion mismatch between core and cladding materials. The mechanical stress could be avoided by an appropriate technique of fiber preform fabrication and drawing, which would prevent the mode field deformation and lead to reliable diffraction-limited fundamental mode guiding for very large core diameters.},

This general treatment incorporates the optomechanical coupling produced by boundary-induced radiation pressures (boundary motion) and material-induced electrostrictive forces (photoelastic effects), permitting straightforward application to a range of emerging micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems. Through a self-consistent fully coupled nonlinear treatment, developed within a general Hamiltonian framework, we establish the connection between the power spectral density of spontaneously scattered light in forward Brillouin interactions and the nonlinear coupling strength. We show that, in sharp contrast to backward Brillouin scattering, noise-initiated stimulated forward Brillouin scattering is forbidden in the majority of experimental systems. In fact, the single-pass gain, which characterizes the threshold for energy transfer in back-scattering processes, is negative for a large class of forward Brillouin devices. Beyond this frequent experimental case, we explore mechanisms for dispersive symmetry breaking that lead to amplification and dynamics reminiscent of backward Brillouin scattering.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetically induced transparency provides a powerful mechanism for controlling light propagation in a dielectric medium, and for producing slow and fast light. Electromagnetically induced transparency traditionally arises from destructive interference induced by a non-radiative coherence in an atomic system. Stimulated Brillouin scattering of light from propagating hypersonic acoustic waves has also been used successfully for the generation of slow and fast light. However, Electromagnetically induced transparency-type processes based on stimulated Brillouin scattering were considered infeasible because of the short coherence lifetime of hypersonic phonons. Here, we report a new Brillouin scattering induced transparency phenomenon generated by acousto-optic interaction of light with long-lived propagating phonons in a silica resonator. We demonstrate that Brillouin scattering induced transparency is uniquely non-reciprocal owing to the propagating acoustic wave and accompanying momentum conservation requirement. We also show that Brillouin scattering induced transparency enables ultralow-power ultralow-footprint slow-light generation with delay-bandwidth product comparable to state-of-the-art stimulated Brillouin scattering systems.},

  abstract = {Shrinking optical metrology The ability to generate laser frequency combs---light sources comprising equidistant laser lines spanning a large range of wavelengths---has revolutionized metrology and precision spectroscopy. The past decade has seen frequency combs being generated in optical microresonator circuits, offering the prospect of shifting precision metrology applications from the realm of national laboratories to that of everyday devices. Kippenberg et al. review the development of microresonator-generated frequency combs and map out how understanding and control of their generation is providing a new basis for precision technology. Science, this issue p. eaan8083 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDLaser frequency combs, which consist of equidistant laser lines, have revolutionized time-keeping, metrology, and spectroscopy. Conventional optical frequency combs based on mode-locked lasers are still mostly confined to scientific laboratories. In recent years, there has been progress in the development of optical frequency combs based on compact, chip-scale microresonators (``microcombs''), with such microcombs operating in the dissipative soliton regime. Dissipative solitons rely on a double balance of nonlinearity and dispersion as well as dissipation and gain and are an example of self-organization in driven dissipative nonlinear systems. Dissipative temporal solitons are providing the long-sought-for regime of coherent, broadband microcomb spectra and in addition provide an experimental setting in which to study dissipative soliton physics. Microcombs are now capable of producing coherent, octave-spanning frequency combs, with microwave to terahertz repetition rates, at low pump power, and in chip-scale devices and have been used in a wide variety of applications, owing to bandwidth and coherence provided by the dissipative temporal soliton states. ADVANCESUnderlying these recent advances has been the observation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons (DKSs) in microresonators, which represent self-enforcing stationary localized solutions of a damped, driven, and detuned nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation, which was originally used to describe spatial self-organization phenomena. They correspond to solitons (localized patterns) in ``open'' systems---that is, systems that exhibit dissipation. DKSs, opposite to fiber solitons, therefore rely on a double balance of nonlinearity and dispersion as well as parametric gain and loss and depend on the laser-cavity detuning as a control parameter. Methods have been established that enable the reliable generation of such DKSs in a wide range of microresonator platforms, including platforms based on silicon nitride (Si3N4) that are compatible with photonic integration. In addition, a variety of previously unknown and nonanticipated soliton effects have been observed, such as soliton crystallization, Raman-Stokes solitons, and previously unseen soliton breather dynamics. Moreover, dissipative solitons have been shown to be suprisingly robust against imperfections in the resonator mode structure. Dissipative soliton states in microresonators have triggered a large number of applications, including in terabit-coherent optical communications, atomic clocks, ultrafast distance measurements, dual-comb spectroscopy, photonic integrated frequency synthesizers, and the calibration of astrophysical spectrometers for exoplanet searches. OUTLOOKThe reliable generation of DKSs in microresonators has established a nascent research field at the interface of soliton physics, frequency metrology, and integrated photonics and provided impetus to microcomb sources. Emerging frontiers include using advances in nanofabrication and materials synthesis to realize ultralow-propagation-loss photonic nanostructures with unusual dispersion properties, which could explore dissipative solitons in new and unexplored parameter regimes and allow the synthesis of even broader spectra that in time domain could correspond to single-cycle pulses and whose spectral bandwidth could be extended to the mid-infrared or visible range. Beyond the narrow class of materials used for DKSs so far (Si, MgF2, SiO2, and Si3N4), many other materials exist with distinct advantages, such as III-V semiconductors, which are already widely used in light-emitting or laser diodes. Beyond existing applications, DKSs could be applied to optical coherence tomography, Raman spectral imaging, chip-scale atomic clocks based on optical transitions, or ultrafast photonic analog-to-digital conversion and have a potential to make frequency metrology and spectroscopy ubiquitous. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6402/eaan8083/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint DKSs in optical microresonators.(A) Principle of DKSs, representing a double balance of dispersion and nonlinearity as well as (parametric) gain and cavity loss.

The optical frequency comb is shown with two dispersive waves that arise from higher-order dispersion.CREDIT: SIMON HOENL, EPFL The development of compact, chip-scale optical frequency comb sources (microcombs) based on parametric frequency conversion in microresonators has seen applications in terabit optical coherent communications, atomic clocks, ultrafast distance measurements, dual-comb spectroscopy, and the calibration of astophysical spectrometers and have enabled the creation of photonic-chip integrated frequency synthesizers. Underlying these recent advances has been the observation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in microresonators, which represent self-enforcing, stationary, and localized solutions of a damped, driven, and detuned nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation, which was first introduced to describe spatial self-organization phenomena. The generation of dissipative Kerr solitons provide a mechanism by which coherent optical combs with bandwidth exceeding one octave can be synthesized and have given rise to a host of phenomena, such as the Stokes soliton, soliton crystals, soliton switching, or dispersive waves. Soliton microcombs are compact, are compatible with wafer-scale processing, operate at low power, can operate with gigahertz to terahertz line spacing, and can enable the implementation of frequency combs in remote and mobile environments outside the laboratory environment, on Earth, airborne, or in outer space.},

  abstract = {Brillouin nonlinearities---which result from coupling between photons and acoustic phonons---are exceedingly weak in conventional nanophotonic silicon waveguides. Only recently have Brillouin interactions been transformed into the strongest and most tailorable nonlinear interactions in silicon using a new class of optomechanical waveguides that control both light and sound. In this paper, we use a multi-mode optomechanical waveguide to create stimulated Brillouin scattering between light-fields guided in distinct spatial modes of an integrated waveguide for the first time. This interaction, termed stimulated inter-modal Brillouin scattering, decouples Stokes and anti-Stokes processes to enable single-sideband amplification and dynamics that permit near-unity power conversion. Using integrated mode multiplexers to address separate optical modes, we show that circulators and narrowband filters are not necessary to separate pump and signal waves. We also demonstrate net optical amplification and Brillouin energy transfer as the basis for flexible on-chip light sources, amplifiers, nonreciprocal devices and signal-processing technologies.},

  abstract = {Non-reciprocal light propagation is essential to control optical crosstalk and back-scatter in photonic systems. However, realizing high-fidelity non-reciprocity in low-loss integrated photonic circuits remains challenging. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a form of non-local acousto-optic light scattering to produce non-reciprocal single-sideband modulation and mode conversion in an integrated silicon photonic platform. In this system, a travelling-wave acoustic phonon driven by optical forces in a silicon waveguide spatiotemporally modulates light in a separate waveguide through linear interband Brillouin scattering. This process extends narrowband optomechanics-based schemes for non-reciprocity to travelling-wave physics, enabling large operation bandwidths of more than 125\,GHz and up to 38\,dB of non-reciprocal contrast between forward- and backward-propagating optical waves. The modulator operation wavelength is tunable over a 35-nm range by varying the optical drive wavelength. Such travelling-wave acousto-optic interactions provide a promising path toward the realization of broadband, low-loss isolators and circulators within integrated photonics.},

Virtually all current approaches fall short in simultaneously achieving strong SBS, low losses, and technological scalability. In this work we incorporate stong SBS into a standard silicon nitride platform by a simple deposition of a tellurium oxide layer, a commonly used material for acousto-optic modulators. In these heterogeneously integrated waveguides, we harness novel SBS interactions actuated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) leading to more than two orders of magnitude gain enhancement. Three novel applications are demonstrated in this platform: (i) a silicon nitride Brillouin amplifier with 5 dB net optical gain, (ii) a compact intermodal stimulated Brillouin laser (SBL) capable of high purity radio frequency (RF) signal generation with 7 Hz intrinsic linewidth, and (iii) a widely tunable microwave photonic notch filter with ultra-narrow linewidth of 2.2 MHz enabled by Brillouin induced opacity. These advancements can unlock an array of new RF and optical technologies to be directly integrated in silicon nitride.},

  abstract = {Generation, processing, and sensing of microwave signals using photonic technologies offer immunity from electromagnetic interference, allow high-speed operation over a wide frequency range, and reduce the overall system weight. Recent developments in integrated photonic technologies further increase the attractiveness of photonics-based radio frequency (RF) systems. Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), due to its inherently narrow bandwidth, wavelength transparent nature, low threshold, and bandwidth reconfigurability, has emerged as a potential contender for microwave photonic (MWP) generation and signal processing. In this article, we present a review of recent developments in the area of SBS-based MWP. We discuss different SBS-based techniques for realizing some of the key MWP signal processing functionalities such as RF generation, filtering, and true time delay. Implementation of these tasks using fiber and on-chip platforms is presented along with the effect of system parameters such as dispersion on their performance. Novel architectures to mitigate these impairments are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed overview of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in                single-mode optical fibers. The review is divided into two parts. In the first part,                we discuss the fundamentals of SBS. A particular emphasis is given to analytical                calculation of the backreflected power and SBS threshold (SBST) in optical fibers                with various index profiles. For this, we consider acousto-optic interaction in the                guiding geometry and derive the modal overlap integral, which describes the                dependence of the Brillouin gain on the refractive index profile of the optical                fiber. We analyze Stokes backreflected power initiated by thermal phonons, compare                values of the SBST calculated from different approximations, and discuss the SBST                dependence on the fiber length. We also review an analytical approach to calculate                the gain of Brillouin fiber amplifiers (BFAs) in the regime of pump depletion. In the                high-gain regime, fiber loss is a nonnegligible effect and needs to be accounted for                along with the pump depletion. We provide an accurate analytic expression for the BFA                gain and show results of experimental validation. Finally, we review methods to                suppress SBS including index-controlled acoustic guiding or segmented fiber links.                The second part of the review deals with recent advances in fiber-optic applications                where SBS is a relevant effect. In particular, we discuss the impact of SBS on the                radio-over-fiber technology, enhancement of the SBS efficiency in Raman-pumped                fibers, slow light due to SBS and SBS-based optical delay lines, Brillouin                fiber-optic sensors, and SBS mitigation in high-power fiber lasers, as well as SBS in                multimode and microstructured fibers. A detailed derivation of evolutional equations                in the guided wave geometry as well as key physical relations are given in                appendices.},

When evacuated, the dual-nanoweb fiber yields a quality factor of {$\sim$}3\,600 and a resonant optomechanical nonlinear coefficient that is {$\sim$}60\,000 times larger than the Kerr effect.},

These two constituent modes have different group delays, which results in an effect termed modal birefringence.

We report an analysis of modal birefringence including scaling rules for fiber design, and provide numerical results for about 50 of the lower order modes.},

  abstract = {Phonon lasers, which exploit coherent amplifications of phonons, are a means to explore nonlinear phononics, image nanomaterial structures and operate phononic devices. Recently, a phonon laser governed by dispersive optomechanical coupling has been demonstrated by levitating a nanosphere in an optical tweezer. Such levitated optomechanical devices, with minimal noise in high vacuum, can allow flexible control of large-mass objects without any internal discrete energy levels. However, it is challenging to achieve phonon lasing with levitated microscale objects because optical scattering losses are much larger than at the nanoscale. Here we report a nonlinear multi-frequency phonon laser with a micro-size sphere, which is governed by dissipative coupling. The active gain provided by a Yb3+-doped system plays a key role. It achieves three orders of magnitude for the amplitude of the fundamental-mode phonon lasing, compared with the passive device. In addition, nonlinear mechanical harmonics can emerge spontaneously above the lasing threshold. Furthermore, we observe coherent correlations of phonons for both the fundamental mode and its harmonics. Our work drives the field of levitated optomechanics into a regime where it becomes feasible to engineer collective motional properties of typical micro-size objects.},

  abstract = {We study an elastic composite described by the position-dependent mass density {$\rho$}(r), the longitudinal speed of sound cl(r), and the transverse speed of sound ct(r). For a spatially periodic composite---a ``phononic crystal''---we derive the eigenvalue equation for the frequencies {$\omega$}n(K), where n is the serial number of the band and K is the Bloch wave vector. This is applied to the special case of a binary composite and, further, to the case of infinite cylinders that form a two-dimensional lattice. For this configuration (and no wave-vector component parallel to the cylinders) there are two independent modes of vibration. The elastic displacement u(r) is parallel to the cylinders for one of them---the transverse polarization mode. The other one is a mixed (longitudinal-transverse) polarization mode with u(r) perpendicular to the cylinders. Specifically we consider circular cylinders that form a square lattice. We compute the band structures for the transverse modes of nickel alloy cylinders in an aluminum alloy host, and vice versa. In both situations we find band gaps which extend throughout the Brillouin zone. Within these gaps the transverse vibrations, sound, and phonons are forbidden. We also investigate the dependence of the band gap on the filling fraction and on the material parameters.},

  abstract = {What sets this volume apart from other mathematics texts is its emphasis on mathematical tools commonly used by scientists and engineers to solve real-world problems. Using a unique approach, it covers intermediate and advanced material in a manner appropriate for undergraduate students. Based on author Bruce Kusse's course at the Department of Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University, Mathematical Physics begins with essentials such as vector and tensor algebra, curvilinear coordinate systems, complex variables, Fourier series, Fourier and Laplace transforms, differential and integral equations, and solutions to Laplace's equations. The book moves on to explain complex topics that often fall through the cracks in undergraduate programs, including the Dirac delta-function, multivalued complex functions using branch cuts, branch points and Riemann sheets, contravariant and covariant tensors, and an introduction to group theory. This expanded second edition contains a new appendix on the calculus of variation -- a valuable addition to the already superb collection of topics on offer. This is an ideal text for upper-level undergraduates in physics, applied physics, physical chemistry, biophysics, and all areas of engineering. It allows physics professors to prepare students for a wide range of employment in science and engineering and makes an excellent reference for scientists and engineers in industry. Worked out examples appear throughout the book and exercises follow every chapter.

  abstract = {Fiber tapers provide a way to rapidly measure the spectra of many types of optical microcavities. Proper fabrication of the taper ensures that its width varies sufficiently slowly (adiabatically) along the length of the taper so as to maintain single spatial mode propagation. This is usually accomplished by monitoring the spectral transmission through the taper. In addition to this characterization method it is also helpful to know the taper width versus length. By developing a model of optical backscattering within the fiber taper, it is possible to use backscatter measurements to characterize the taper width versus length. The model uses the concept of a local taper numerical aperture to accurately account for varying backscatter collection along the length of the taper. In addition to taper profile information, the backscatter reflectometry method delineates locations along the taper where fluctuations in fiber core refractive index, cladding refractive index, and taper surface roughness each provide the dominant source of backscattering. Rayleigh backscattering coefficients are also extracted by fitting the data with the model and are consistent with the fiber manufacturer\&\#x02019;s datasheet. The optical backscattering reflectometer is also used to observe defects resulting from microcracks and surface contamination. All of this information can be obtained before the taper is removed from its fabrication apparatus. The backscattering method should also be prove useful for characterization of nanofibers.},

The band structure of acoustic phonons is obtained from this full-vector computation. The analysis is applied to the case of a photonic crystal fiber possessing a honeycomb lattice. It is shown that this fiber exhibits band gaps for elastic modes propagating along the longitudinal fiber axis. For frequencies within a band gap, the external boundary of the fiber becomes a defect of the phononic crystal that supports the propagation of guided elastic modes. Such boundary modes are very sensitive to the boundary conditions. The further introduction of a defect within the two-dimensional phononic crystal leads to the formation of highly confined elastic waveguide modes that copropagate in the same core volume as the guided optical mode. We consider the application of these properties to the suppression of stimulated Brillouin scattering and to enhanced collinear acousto-optical interactions. In particular, we obtain the optimum elastic modal shape that maximizes the acousto-optical scattering coefficient for given optical modes.},

We have demonstrated that this new mode analysis technique has high sensitivity (\&lt;60 dB) and very good resolution (\&lt;1 ps/m).},

However, achieving acoustic waveguides with low loss, tailorability, and easy fabrication remains a challenge. Here, inspired by the optical anti-resonance in hollow-core fibers, we propose suspended anti-resonant acoustic waveguides (SARAWs) with superior confinement and high selectivity of acoustic modes, supporting both forward and backward SBS on chip. Furthermore, this structure streamlines the design and fabrication processes. Leveraging the advantages of SARAWs, we have showcased a series of record-breaking results for SBS within a compact footprint on the silicon-on-insulator platform. For forward SBS, a centimeter-scale SARAW supports a large net gain exceeding 6.4 dB. For backward SBS, we have observed an unprecedented Brillouin frequency shift of 27.6 GHz and a mechanical quality factor of up to 1,960 in silicon waveguides. This paradigm of acoustic waveguide propels SBS into a new era, unlocking new opportunities in the fields of optomechanics, phononic circuits, and hybrid quantum systems.},

Here, with standard silica optical fibres, we report the first experimental observation of temporal cavity solitons. The cavity solitons are 4 ps long and are used to demonstrate storage of a data stream for more than a second. We also observe interactions of close cavity solitons, revealing for our set-up a potential capacity of up to 45,000 bits at 25 Gbit s-1. More fundamentally, cavity solitons are localized dissipative structures. Therefore, given that silica exhibits a pure instantaneous Kerr nonlinearity, our experiment constitutes one of the simplest examples of self-organization phenomena in nonlinear optics.},

  abstract = {Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), originating from the coupling between optical and acoustic waves, has been widely applied in many fields. Silicon is the most used and important material in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and integrated photonic circuits. However, strong acoustic-optic interaction in silicon requires mechanical release of the silicon core waveguide to avoid acoustic energy leakage into the substrate. This will not only reduce the mechanical stability and thermal conduction, but also increase the difficulties for fabrication and large-area device integration. In this paper, we propose a silicon-aluminium nitride(AlN)-sapphire platform for realizing large SBS gain without suspending the waveguide. AlN is used as a buffer layer to reduce the phonon leakage. This platform can be fabricated via the wafer bonding between silicon and commercial AlN-sapphire wafer. We adopt a full-vectorial model to simulate the SBS gain. Both the material loss and the anchor loss of the silicon are considered. We also apply the genetic algorithm to optimize the waveguide structure. By limiting the maximum etching step number to two, we obtain a simple structure to achieve the SBS gain of 2462 W\&\#x2212;1m\&\#x2212;1 for forward SBS, which is 8 times larger than the recently reported result in unsuspended silicon waveguide. Our platform can enable Brillouin-related phenomena in centimetre-scale waveguides. Our findings could pave the way toward large-area unreleased opto-mechanics on silicon.},

Photonic-based microwave-wave sources now provide record, close-to-carrier phase-noise performance, and compact sources using microcavities are available commercially. Photonics-based solutions address a challenging scaling problem in electronics, increasing attenuation with frequency. A second scaling challenge, however, is to maintain low phase noise in reduced form factor and even integrated systems. On this second front, there has been remarkable progress in the area of microcavity devices with large storage time (high optical quality factor). Here we report generation of highly coherent microwaves using a chip-based device that derives stability from high optical quality factor. The device has a record low electronic white-phase-noise floor for a microcavity-based oscillator and is used as the optical, voltage-controlled oscillator in the first demonstration of a photonic-based, microwave frequency synthesizer.

In the proposed MPF, a phase-modulated signal is sent to a PS-FBG. If one of the sidebands falls in the notch of the PS-FBG, the phase-modulated signal is converted to an intensity-modulated signal. Due to the ultra-narrow notch of the PS-FBG, a microwave filter with an ultra-narrow passband is realized. The tunability of the microwave filter is achieved by tuning the wavelength of the optical carrier. A theoretical analysis is performed in which the value of the phase shift and the location of the phase shift in the PS-FBG on the frequency response of the MPF are studied. Two PS-FBGs with different reflection bandwidths and different phase-shift values introduced at the center of the gratings are fabricated and incorporated into the proposed MPF. For the two PS-FBGs, the 3-dB bandwidths are 120 and 60 MHz and the tunable ranges are 5.5 and 15 GHz.},

With optical sideband processing, phase modulation signal is converted to intensity modulation signal for direct detection and nonlinearity compensation is realized to suppress third-order intermodulation distortion simultaneously. Theoretical analysis shows that, by imposing proper phase shifts on zero and second-order optical sidebands, corresponding third-order intermodulation distortion components can cancel each other. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out for verification. Experimental results demonstrate a 30.06 dB suppression of third-order intermodulation distortion and the linearized link's dynamic range can also be improved by 17.42 dB compared with the nonlinearized link, which verify well a highly linearized phase-modulation direct-detection microwave photonics link using this proposal.},

Here we predict and give experimental evidence for the self-feedback induced optical bistability in dual-beam intracavity optical tweezers. Then the characteristics of these bistable potential wells are investigated. The results show that we can prevent the bistable behaviors from destabilizing the trapping stability through tuning the foci offset of two propagating beams in the cavity. This contributes to the use of intracavity optical tweezers as a powerful tool for optical manipulation. Importantly, the thermally activated transition of the trapped particle in the bistable potential is observed for particular experimental parameters. Further investigation of this phenomenon could underlie the mechanism of many metastable-related processes in physics, chemistry, and biology.},

F-SBS gives rise to nonlinear wave mixing along optical fibers, which adds up with four-wave mixing induced by the Kerr effect. In this work, we report the distributed mapping of nonlinear wave mixing processes involving both mechanisms along standard single-mode fiber, in analysis, simulation, and experiment. Measurements are based on a multi-tone, optical time-domain reflectometry setup, which is highly frequency-selective. The results show that F-SBS leads to nonlinear wave mixing processes that are more complex than those that are driven by the Kerr effect alone. The dynamics are strongly dependent on the exact frequency detuning between optical field components. When the detuning is chosen near an F-SBS resonance, the process becomes asymmetric. Power is coupled from an upper-frequency input pump wave to a lower-frequency one, and the amplification of Stokes-wave sidebands is more pronounced than that of anti-Stokes-wave sidebands. The results are applicable to a new class of distributed fiber-optic sensors, based on F-SBS.},

The beat period is measured by detecting the envelope of the Brillouin beat signal, which gives the beat length at different fiber locations, so that birefringence can be calculated accordingly. The distributed birefringence of a 1.7\&\#xA0;km SMF-28 and a 4.3\&\#xA0;km large-effective-area fiber were measured with 0.6\&\#xA0;m spatial resolution without frequency scanning of the Brillouin spectrum.},

  abstract = {Optical manipulation in the vicinity of optical micro- and nanofibres has shown potential across several fields in recent years, including microparticle control and cold atom probing and trapping. To date, most work has focussed on the propagation of the fundamental mode through the fibre. However, along the maximum mode intensity axis, higher order modes have a longer evanescent field extension and larger field amplitude at the fibre waist compared to the fundamental mode, opening up new possibilities for optical manipulation and particle trapping. We demonstrate a microfibre/optical tweezers compact system for trapping and propelling dielectric particles based on the excitation of the first group of higher order modes at the fibre waist. Speed enhancement of polystyrene particle propulsion was observed for the higher order modes compared to the fundamental mode for particles ranging from 1\>{$\mu$}m to 5\>{$\mu$}m in diameter. The optical propelling velocity of a single, 3\>{$\mu$}m polystyrene particle was found to be 8 times faster under the higher order mode than the fundamental mode field for a waist power of 25\>mW. Experimental data are supported by theoretical calculations. This work can be extended to trapping and manipulation of laser-cooled atoms with potential for quantum networks.},

We present a full modal-analysis of the guided optical and acoustic modes based on a two-dimensional finite-element method (2D-FEM) for BGS calculation using COMSOL Multiphysics. We believe that this method will be helpful in analyzing and designing special fibers for applications, such as fiber amplifiers with significant SBS (Stimulated Brillouin Scattering) suppression or Brillouin-based fiber sensors. The model is adapted for BGS evaluation of any single mode fiber (in term of optical mode) based on its profile, namely its geometry, and its doping composition. Compared to standard multi-layer methods limited to axially-symmetric fibers [1], the 2D-FEM analysis enables the BGS computation even for more complicated geometries, such as PANDA polarization-maintaining fiber where the optical index and the material stress are azimuthally dependant. The results of numerical modeling have shown good agreement with measured Brillouin spectra for different types of silica fibers. Examples are given for a standard GeO2-doped core fiber (standard fiber for telecommunication applications), Fluor-doped cladding fiber (acoustic anti-waveguide) and PANDA fiber.},

Fiber birefringence is the origin of the well-known polarization mode dispersion (PMD), which degrades system performances. The knowledge of birefringence properties may be crucial, especially when problems like development of low-PMD fibers or PMD interaction with optical nonlinearities in very high-capacity systems are faced. Some techniques are known to measure birefringence, and useful results have been obtained for both installed and wound-on-drum fibers. However,measurement of the circular component of birefringence still presents difficulties. In this paper, a new method for circular birefringence measurement is proposed that applies to long single-mode twisted fibers. The technique is based on polarization-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometry. Experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis.},

This complicates fabrication, limits thermalization, reduces the mechanical robustness, and hinders large-area optomechanical devices on a single chip. Here, we overcome this limitation by employing vertical photonic-phononic engineering to drastically reduce mechanical leakage into the cladding by adding a pedestal with specific properties between the core and the cladding. We apply this concept to a silicon-based platform, due to the remarkable properties of silicon to enhance optomechanical interactions and the technological relevance of silicon devices in multiple applications. Specifically, the insertion of a thick silicon nitride layer between the silicon guiding core and the silica substrate contributes to reducing gigahertz-frequency phonon leakage while enabling large values of the Brillouin gain in an unreleased platform. We numerically obtain values of the Brillouin gain around 300(W m)-1 for different configurations, which could be further increased by operation at cryogenic temperatures. These values should enable Brillouin-related phenomena in centimeter-scale waveguides or in more compact ring resonators. Our findings could pave the way toward large-area unreleased-cavity and waveguide optomechanics on silicon and other high-index photonic technologies.},

  abstract = {The Year 2022 marks 100 years since Leon Brillouin predicted and theoretically described the interaction of optical waves with acoustic waves in a medium. Accordingly, this resonant multi-wave interaction is referred to as Brillouin scattering. Today, Brillouin scattering has found a multitude of applications, ranging from microscopy of biological tissue, remote sensing over many kilometers, and signal processing in compact photonic integrated circuits smaller than the size of a thumbnail. What allows Brillouin scattering to be harnessed over such different length scales and research domains are its unique underlying properties, namely, its narrow linewidth in the MHz range, a frequency shift in the GHz range, large frequency selective gain or loss, frequency tunability, and optical reconfigurability. Brillouin scattering is also a ubiquitous effect that can be observed in many different media, such as freely propagating in gases and liquids, as well as over long lengths of low-loss optical glass fibers or short semiconductor waveguides. A recent trend of Brillouin research focuses on micro-structured waveguides and integrated photonic platforms. The reduction in the size of waveguides allows tailoring the overlap between the optical and acoustic waves and promises many novel applications in a compact footprint. In this review article, we give an overview of the evolution and development of the field of Brillouin scattering over the last one hundred years toward current lines of active research. We provide the reader with a perspective of recent trends and challenges that demand further research efforts and give an outlook toward the future of this exciting and diverse research field.},

Recent approaches based on optomechanical resonators have achieved impressive quality factors allowing for storage of optical signals. However, so far these techniques have been limited in bandwidth and are incompatible with multi-wavelength operation. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a coherent buffer in an integrated planar optical waveguide by transferring the optical information coherently to an acoustic hypersound wave. Optical information is extracted using the reverse process. These hypersound phonons have similar wavelengths as the optical photons but travel at five orders of magnitude lower velocity. We demonstrate the storage of phase and amplitude of optical information with gigahertz bandwidth and show operation at separate wavelengths with negligible cross-talk.},

  abstract = {Efficient and extended light storage mechanisms are pivotal in photonics, particularly in optical communications, microwave photonics, and quantum networks, as they offer a direct route to circumvent electrical conversion losses and surmount bandwidth constraints. Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) is an established method to store optical information by transferring it to the acoustic domain, but current on-chip SBS efforts have limited bandwidth or storage time due to the phonon lifetime of several nanoseconds. An alternate approach known as quasi-light storage (QLS), which involves the creation of delayed replicas of optical data pulses via SBS in conjunction with a frequency comb, has been proposed to lift the storage time constraint; however, its realization has been confined to lengthy optical fibers, constraining integration with on-chip optical elements and form factors. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of QLS on a photonic chip leveraging the large SBS gain of chalcogenide glass, achieving delays of up to 500~ns for 1~ns long signal pulses, surpassing typical Brillouin storage processes' acoustic lifetime by more than an order of magnitude and waveguide transit time by two orders of magnitude. We experimentally and numerically investigate the dynamics of on-chip QLS and reveal that the interplay between the acoustic wave that stores the optical signal and subsequent optical pump pulses leads to a reshaping of the acoustic field. Our demonstrations illustrate the potential for achieving ultra-long storage times of individual pulses by several hundred pulse widths, marking a significant stride toward advancing the field of all-optical storage and delay mechanisms.},

As a field, it has been hugely successful in the production of precise and novel sensors, the development of low-dissipation nanomechanical devices, and the manipulation of quantum signals. Micro- and nano-particles levitated in optical fields act as nanoscale oscillators, making them excellent low-dissipation optomechanical objects, with minimal thermal contact to the environment when operating in vacuum. Levitated optomechanics is seen as the most promising route for studying high-mass quantum physics, with the promise of creating macroscopically separated superposition states at masses of 106 amu and above. Optical feedback, both using active monitoring or the passive interaction with an optical cavity, can be used to cool the centre-of-mass of levitated nanoparticles well below 1 mK, paving the way to operation in the quantum regime. In addition, trapped mesoscopic particles are the paradigmatic system for studying nanoscale stochastic processes, and have already demonstrated their utility in state-of-the-art force sensing.},

Therefore, the vector field profile in a few-mode fiber must be expressed in terms of the true eigenmodes with complex amplitudes involving a phase difference corresponding to the propagation distance. Owing to this property of LP mode propagation, the propagation characteristics of few-mode fibers cannot be accurately analyzed using conventional LP modes. In this study, the crosstalk between LP11 quasi-degenerate modes due to offset connection is accurately analyzed using matrix formalism expressing the linear combination of true eigenmodes. The difference in the analytical results between the LP modes and the eigenmodes revealed that the propagation of few-mode fibers should be analyzed using true eigenmodes.},

  abstract = {In the span of four decades, quantum computation has evolved from an intellectual curiosity to a potentially realizable technology. Today, small-scale demonstrations have become possible for quantum algorithmic primitives on hundreds of physical qubits and proof-of-principle error-correction on a single logical qubit. Nevertheless, despite significant progress and excitement, the path toward a full-stack scalable technology is largely unknown. There are significant outstanding quantum hardware, fabrication, software architecture, and algorithmic challenges that are either unresolved or overlooked. These issues could seriously undermine the arrival of utility-scale quantum computers for the foreseeable future. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of these scaling challenges. We show how the road to scaling could be paved by adopting existing semiconductor technology to build much higher-quality qubits, employing system engineering approaches, and performing distributed quantum computation within heterogeneous high-performance computing infrastructures. These opportunities for research and development could unlock certain promising applications, in particular, efficient quantum simulation/learning of quantum data generated by natural or engineered quantum systems. To estimate the true cost of such promises, we provide a detailed resource and sensitivity analysis for classically hard quantum chemistry calculations on surface-code error-corrected quantum computers given current, target, and desired hardware specifications based on superconducting qubits, accounting for a realistic distribution of errors. Furthermore, we argue that, to tackle industry-scale classical optimization and machine learning problems in a cost-effective manner, distributed quantum-assisted probabilistic computing with custom-designed accelerators should be considered as a complementary path toward scalability.},

Having shown the ineffectiveness of elliptical cores to induce large birefringence in hollow core fibers, we focus on designing and optimizing polarization maintaining Hollow Core Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fibers (HC-NANF). In a first approach, we create and exploit anti-crossings with glass modes at different wavelengths for the two polarizations. We show that suitable low loss high birefringence regions can be obtained by appropriately modifying the thickness of tubes along one direction while leaving the tubes in the orthogonal direction unchanged and in antiresonance. Using this concept, we propose a new birefringent NANF design providing low loss ({\textasciitilde}40dB/km) and high birefringence (\&gt;10\&\#x2212;4) over a record bandwidth of {\textasciitilde}550nm, and discuss how bandwidth can be traded off to further reduce the loss to a few dB/km. Finally, we propose a polarization mode-stripping technique in the birefringent NANF. As a demonstration, we propose a polarizing birefringent NANF design that can achieve orthogonal polarization loss ratios as large as 30dB over the C-band while eliminating any undesirable polarization coupling effect thereby resulting in a single polarization output in a hollow core fiber regardless of the input polarization state.},

  abstract = {A new measurement technique, capable of quantifying the number and type of modes propagating in large-mode-area fibers is both proposed and demonstrated. The measurement is based on both spatially and spectrally resolving the image of the output of the fiber under test. The measurement provides high quality images of the modes that can be used to identify the mode order, while at the same time returning the power levels of the higher-order modes relative to the fundamental mode. Alternatively the data can be used to provide statistics on the level of beam pointing instability and mode shape changes due to random uncontrolled fluctuations of the phases between the coherent modes propagating in the fiber. An added advantage of the measurement is that is requires no prior detailed knowledge of the fiber properties in order to identify the modes and quantify their relative power levels. Because of the coherent nature of the measurement, it is far more sensitive to changes in beam properties due to the mode content in the beam than is the more traditional M2 measurement for characterizing beam quality. We refer to the measurement as Spatially and Spectrally resolved imaging of mode content in fibers, or more simply as S2 imaging.},

This technology has introduced new possibilities to the design of efficient circuits and components operating in the radio frequency (RF) and microwave frequency spectrum. Microstrip components are very good for low frequency applications but are ineffective at extreme frequencies, and involve rigorous fabrication concessions in the implementation of RF, microwave, and millimeter-wave components. This is due to wavelengths being short at higher frequencies. Waveguide devices, on the other hand, are ideal for higher frequency systems, but are very costly, hard to fabricate, and challenging to integrate with planar components in the neighborhood. SIW connects the gap that existed between conventional air-filled rectangular waveguide and planar transmission line technologies including the microstrip. This study explores the current advancements and new opportunities in SIW implementation of RF and microwave devices including filters, multiplexers (diplexers and triplexers), power dividers/combiners, antennas, and sensors for modern communication systems.},

  abstract = {Making silicon shine bright Silicon is the workhorse of the semiconductor electronics industry, but its lack of optical functionality is a barrier to developing a truly integrated silicon-based optoelectronics platform. Although there are several ways of exploiting nonlinear light-matter interactions to coax silicon into optical functionality, the effects tend to be weak. Otterstrom et al. used a suspended silicon waveguide racetrack structure to stimulate the stronger nonlinear effect of Brillouin scattering and achieve lasing from silicon. The ability to engineer the nonlinearity and tune the optical response through the design of the suspended cavity provides a powerful and flexible route for developing silicon-based optoelectronic circuits and devices. Science, this issue p. 1113 Brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits. Brillouin scattering is exploited to develop a silicon laser.

  abstract = {Guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering has gained considerable interest in recent years because of its capacity to detect mechanical features of materials surrounding the optical fiber. Nevertheless, distributed measurements using this mechanism are rarely taken because of the impracticality of the method's forward scattering mechanism. Recently, remarkable work using ingenious schemes has managed to address the difficulty, which opens a brand new way to achieve position-resolved substance identification. However, due to the long acoustic wave lifetime and insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), current spatial resolution is restricted to 15--50 m, which is far from practical requirements. Here we propose a novel opto-mechanical time-domain analysis based on coherent forward stimulated Brillouin scattering probing to greatly improve the achievable spatial resolution. The coherent transverse acoustic wave is first created by a long activation pulse and then probed by a short two-tone probe pulse. The two-tone probing process involves a coherent stimulated interaction between the probe pulse and the excited transverse acoustic wave. The interaction, which we first propose here, shows a distinct phase-sensitive characteristic. This new coherent stimulated probing process, if it is well controlled, will enhance the forward stimulated Brillouin scattering intensity and thus improve the SNR of the sensing. Moreover, higher SNR backward stimulated Brillouin scattering is used to detect the intensity evolution of the probe pulse. Owing to this new sensing scheme combined with a more robust demodulation algorithm, we demonstrated a 2 m spatial resolution opto-mechanical measurement over a 225 m long fiber in which we were able to distinguish air from alcohol. These advances greatly facilitate the practicability of forward stimulated Brillouin scattering.},

CBF measurements are important for assessing whether blood flow has returned to presurgical baseline levels and for assessing postsurgical tissue viability. Existing techniques for intraoperative monitoring of CBF based on magnetic resonance imaging are expensive and often impractical, while techniques such as indocyanine green angiography cannot produce quantitative measures of blood flow. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical technique that has been widely used to quantitatively image relative CBF in animal models in vivo. In a pilot clinical study, we adapted an existing neurosurgical operating microscope to obtain LSCI images in humans in real time during neurosurgery under baseline conditions and after bipolar cautery. Simultaneously recorded ECG waveforms from the patient were used to develop a filter that helped reduce measurement variabilities due to motion artifacts. Results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of using LSCI to obtain blood flow images during neurosurgeries and its capability to produce full field CBF image maps with excellent spatial resolution in real-time with minimal disruption to the surgical procedure.},

The self-heterodyne autocorrelation function and power spectrum are evaluated, and by numerical analysis we ensure that -3 dB of the power spectrum is applied to the self-heterodyne linewidth measurements.

Inspired by the pioneering work of Arthur Ashkin on optical tweezers22,23, we introduce a mesoscopic, frequency-tunable phonon laser based on the centre-of-mass oscillation of a silica nanosphere levitated in an optical tweezer under vacuum. Unlike previous levitated realizations, our scheme is general enough to be used on single electrons, liquid droplets or even small biological organisms24. Our device thus provides a pathway for a coherent source of phonons on the mesoscale that can be applied to both fundamental problems in quantum mechanics as well as tasks of precision metrology25--27.},

As a result, the HC-NANF can in principle reach a total value of loss -- including leakage, surface scattering and bend contributions -- that is lower than that of conventional solid fibers. Besides, through resonant out-coupling of high order modes they can be made to behave as effectively single mode fibers.},

This full-vectorial formulation of SBS coupling rigorously accounts for the effects of both radiation pressure and electrostriction within micro- and nano-scale waveguides. We show that both contributions play a critical role in SBS coupling as modal confinement approaches the sub-wavelength scale. Through analysis of each contribution to the optical force, we show that spatial symmetry of the optical force dictates the selection rules of the excitable elastic modes. By applying this method to a rectangular silicon waveguide, we demonstrate how the optical force distribution and elastic modal profiles jointly determine the magnitude and scaling of SBS gains in both forward and backward SBS processes. We further apply this method to the study of intra- and inter-modal SBS processes, and demonstrate that the coupling between distinct optical modes are necessary to excite elastic modes with all possible symmetries. For example, we show that strong inter-polarization coupling can be achieved between the fundamental TE- and TM-like modes of a suspended silicon waveguide.},

  abstract = {Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is traditionally viewed as a process whose strength is dictated by intrinsic material nonlinearities with little dependence on waveguide geometry. We show that this paradigm breaks down at the nanoscale, as tremendous radiation pressures produce new forms of SBS nonlinearities. A coherent combination of radiation pressure and electrostrictive forces is seen to enhance both forward and backward SBS processes by orders of magnitude, creating new geometric degrees of freedom through which photon-phonon coupling becomes highly tailorable. At nanoscales, the backward-SBS gain is seen to be 104 times greater than in conventional silica fibers with 100 times greater values than predicted by conventional SBS treatments. Furthermore, radically enhanced forward-SBS processes are 105 times larger than any known waveguide system. In addition, when nanoscale silicon waveguides are cooled to low temperatures, a further 10--100 times increase in SBS gain is seen as phonon losses are reduced. As a result, a 100-{$\mu$}m segment of the waveguide has equivalent nonlinearity to a kilometer of fiber. Couplings of this magnitude would enable efficient chip-scale stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon waveguides for the first time. More generally, we develop a new full-vectorial theoretical formulation of stimulated Brillouin scattering that accurately incorporates the effects of boundary-induced nonlinearities and radiation pressure, both of which are seen to have tremendous impact on photon-phonon coupling at subwavelength scales. This formalism, which treats both intermode and intramode coupling within periodic and translationally invariant waveguide systems, reveals a rich landscape of new stimulated Brillouin processes when applied to nanoscale systems.},

  abstract = {Radiation pressure is known to scale to large values in engineered micro and nanoscale photonic waveguide systems. In addition to radiation pressure, dielectric materials also exhibit strain-dependent refractive index changes, through which optical fields can induce electrostrictive forces. To date, little attention has been paid to the electrostrictive component of optical forces in high-index contrast waveguides. In this paper, we examine the magnitude, scaling, and spatial distribution of electrostrictive forces through analytical and numerical models, revealing that electrostrictive forces increase to large values in high index-contrast waveguides. Similar to radiation pressure, electrostrictive forces increase quadratically with the optical field. However, since electrostrictive forces are determined by the material photoelastic tensor, the sign of the electrostrictive force is highly material-dependent, resulting in cancellation with radiation pressure in some instances. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the optical forces resulting from both radiation pressure and electrostriction can scale to remarkably high levels (i.e., greater than 104(N/m2)) for realistic guided powers. Additionally, even in simple rectangular waveguides, the magnitude and distribution of both forces can be engineered at the various boundaries of the waveguide system by choice of material system and geometry of the waveguide.This tailorability points towards novel and simple waveguide designs which enable selective excitation of elastic waves with desired symmetries through engineered stimulated Brillouin scattering processes in nanoscale waveguide systems.},

The basic birefringences that couple the two modes and change the polarization state along the fiber are reviewed. The three cases of uniform, phase-matched, and random coupling are considered. Polarization preservation in both low- and high-birefringence fibers is achieved by reducing this coupling. In addition to polarization-state changes, bireftingent fibers can quickly reduce the polarization degree of nonmonochromatic light if both modes are excited, a characteristic that greatly simplifies evaluation of the degree of polarization preservation in these fibers. Current evaluations of the birefringence and the polarization-holding ability of state-of-the-art fibers are discussed, and it is concluded that fibers with good polarization-holding properties are becoming available.},

The main driving forces were the greater utilization of available bandwidth, that necessitates extremely low dielectric loss (high-quality factor), an increase in permittivity so that smaller components could be fabricated, and, as ever in the commercial world, cost reduction. Over the last decade, a clear picture has emerged of the principal factors, that influence MW properties.

  abstract = {Recent developments in micromachining techniques at the University of Michigan have resulted in novel high-performance low-loss filters for microwave and millimeter-wave applications. The idea is based on suspending the filters on thin dielectric membranes to eliminate dielectric loss and dispersion problems, resulting in a pure TEM mode of propagation and conductor-loss-limited performance. The dielectric membrane and the surrounding cavities are built using chemical etching in Silicon and GaAs wafers. The filters are therefore compatible with low-cost IC fabrication techniques and can be combined with planar diodes and transistors to result in active filter networks. Several state-of-the-art filters have been realized including 15-GHz and 20-GHz bandpass interdigital suspended stripline filters, lowpass and bandpass microshield filters at 30 GHz and 90 GHz, microstrip 94-GHz bandpass filters, and a 250-GHz bandpass filter with 1.0--1.5-dB insertion loss. This article reviews the associated fabrication techniques, the different types of transmission lines achieved using this technology, and the measured performance from 15 to 350 GHz. The study concludes with a detailed description of the future work in this area. {\copyright} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Int J Microwave Millimeter-Wave CAE 7: 149--166, 1997.},

The experimental results are corroborated by multi-physics simulations, revealing that relatively strong optomechanical coupling is mediated by a combination of electrostriction and radiation pressure within the nano-scale silica-air matrix; the nontrivial mechanical properties of this silica-air matrix facilitate the large optomechanical response produced by this system. Simulations also reveal an incredible sensitivity of the Brillouin spectrum to fiber critical dimensions, suggesting opportunity for enhancement or suppression of these interactions.

While much is known about the optical properties of these fibers, relatively little is known about their optomechanical properties. Here we identify a new form of optomechanical coupling in gas-filled hollow-core fibers. We show that forward Brillouin scattering is produced by air in the core of a photonic bandgap fiber. A single Brillouin resonance is identified at 35 MHz, which corresponds to a guided sound wave within the center of an air-filled hollow-core fiber. A simple analytical model, refined by numerical simulations, is developed that accurately predicts the Brillouin coupling strength and frequency from the gas and fiber parameters, revealing that this optomechanical interaction is highly tailorable. This new mechanism could become the basis for new types of sensing and spectroscopy. Moreover, this previously unknown nonlinearity within hollow core fibers represents a power and noise limitation that requires further consideration.},

Optical fibres designed to support multiple transverse modes offer opportunities to study wave propagation in a setting that is intermediate between single-mode fibre and free-space propagation. Here we report the observation of optical solitons and soliton self-frequency shifting in graded-index multimode fibre. These wave packets can be modelled as multicomponent solitons, or as solitons of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation. Solitons in graded-index fibres should enable increased data rates in low-cost telecommunications systems, are pertinent to space-division multiplexing, and can offer a new route to mode-area scaling for high-power lasers and transmission.},

Mode-selective couplers rely on the phase-matching of a higher-order mode in one fiber with the fundamental mode of a second, closely-positioned fiber. Their behavior is shown to be highly-dependent on the principle and azimuthal mode numbers of the higher-order mode, as well as its spatial-orientation. Zero coupling is shown to be possible for an asymmetric higher-order mode even when there is perfect phase-matching. The theory is also numerically simulated, and could assist in the future design of efficient mode-selective couplers for a wide range of optical communications and sensor systems.},

The propagating light through the PCF can be controlled by varying the structural parameters and core-cladding materials, as a result, evanescent field can be enhanced significantly which is the main component of the PCF based gas/chemical sensors.

  abstract = {In this thesis, I report on the cooling of a macroscopic harmonic mechanical oscillator of mass on the order of 10ng close to its quantum ground state. To perform the refrigeration, we exploit the optomechanical interaction that couples the mechanical degree of freedom to an optical cavity mode via the light's radiation pressure. The delayed response of the intracavity field upon mechanical vibration leads to a viscous intracavity radiation pressure force responsible for the dynamical backaction cooling, as is theoretically introduced in chapter 1. In chapter 2, we review the experimental system accommodating this process: the silica microtoroidal cavity. It advantageously hosts a significant optomechanical coupling between the supported high-finesse (close to 10{\textasciicircum}6) optical whispering-gallery modes and the mechanical radial breathing mode oscillating at radio frequencies (tens of MHz). In chapter 3, we detail the experimental efforts performed to improve the effect of the cooling on the system and thus to reach a lower average number of mechanical energy quanta, or phonons. The various sources of mechanical dissipations are studied. Their magnitude is diminished by optimizing the mechanical structure, therefore reducing the coupling of the mechanical mode to its warm thermal environment. In the newly developed spoke-anchored toroidal microcavities, engineering the intermode coupling minimizes the system's damping down to the limit imposed by the properties of the vitreous silica material. To reduce the temperature of the environment itself, the experiment is pre-cooled first in a prototype helium-4 cryostat. This enables the observation of novel dispersive optical properties of fused silica and the study of the sample's thermalization at cryogenic temperatures. To further increase the pre-cooling, the setup is finally implemented in a colder helium-3 cryostat operated at 850mK. Using the balanced homodyne interferometer constructed to detect the mechanical vibration with quantum-limited sensitivity, we report on the cooling performed in the resolved-sideband configuration that is fundamentally required to reach the ground state. A mean phonon occupancy of 9 +/-1 is achieved. The fact that only simple technical problems limit further cooling proves that the developed experimental system is finally optimized for revealing quantum signatures of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator cooled by dynamical backaction. Finally, the effect of the optomechanical interaction on the optical properties of the cavity is measured and analyzed, leading to the first observation of optomechanically induced transparency. This constitutes an experimental manifestation of the mutual character of interaction between light and mechanical motion.},

  abstract = {Today, acoustic filters are the filter technology to meet the requirements with respect to performance dictated by the cellular phone standards and their form factor. Around two billion cellular phones are sold every year, and smart phones are of a very high percentage of approximately two-thirds. Smart phones require a very high number of filter functions ranging from the low double-digit range up to almost triple digit numbers in the near future. In the frequency range up to 1 GHz, surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters are almost exclusively employed, while in the higher frequency range, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) and SAW filters are competing for their shares. Prerequisites for the success of acoustic filters were the availability of high-quality substrates, advanced and highly reproducible fabrication technologies, optimum filter techniques, precise simulation software, and advanced design tools that allow the fast and efficient design according to customer specifications. This paper will try to focus on innovations leading to high volume applications of intermediate frequency (IF) and radio frequency (RF) acoustic filters, e.g., TV IF filters, IF filters for cellular phones, and SAW/BAW RF filters for the RF front-end of cellular phones.},

The phenomenon is examined in detail, and the governing differential equations of the three-wave parametric process, (involving laser pump, Brillouin signal, and acoustic flexural-wave phonon) are derived and solved. FSBS is possible because although the overlap integral between a flexural fiber mode and the light is small, the phonon lifetime is much longer than in conventional stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). FSBS may also be the first example of a nonlinear effect which is enhanced by increasing the optical model area at constant pump power.{$<<$}ETX{$>>$}},

  abstract = {Radio-frequency communication systems have long used bulk- and surface-acoustic-wave devices supporting ultrasonic mechanical waves to manipulate and sense signals. These devices have greatly improved our ability to process microwaves by interfacing them to orders-of-magnitude slower and lower-loss mechanical fields. In parallel, long-distance communications have been dominated by low-loss infrared optical photons. As electrical signal processing and transmission approach physical limits imposed by energy dissipation, optical links are now being actively considered for mobile and cloud technologies. Thus there is a strong driver for wavelength-scale mechanical wave or \&\#x201C;phononic\&\#x201D; circuitry fabricated by scalable semiconductor processes. With the advent of these circuits, new micro- and nanostructures that combine electrical, optical, and mechanical elements have emerged. In these devices, such as optomechanical waveguides and resonators, optical photons and gigahertz phonons are ideally matched to one another, as both have wavelengths on the order of micrometers. The development of phononic circuits has thus emerged as a vibrant field of research pursued for optical signal processing and sensing applications as well as emerging quantum technologies. In this review, we discuss the key physics and figures of merit underpinning this field. We also summarize the state of the art in nanoscale electro- and optomechanical systems with a focus on scalable platforms such as silicon. Finally, we give perspectives on what these new systems may bring and what challenges they face in the coming years. In particular, we believe hybrid electro- and optomechanical devices incorporating highly coherent and compact mechanical elements on a chip have significant untapped potential for electro-optic modulation, quantum microwave-to-optical photon conversion, sensing, and microwave signal processing.},

Direct frequency modulation characteristics of the laser transmitter are studied by observing the intermediate frequency spectra. Frequency modulation-demodulation of pulse pattern signals at 100-200 Mbit/s is demonstrated. Reduction of the intermediate frequency fluctuation to less than 5 MHz is realized by employing a feedback of the RF frequency discriminator output to the local oscillator injection current.},

An all-optical pump and probe technique is used for efficient excitation and accurate characterization of both, radial and torsional-radial acoustic resonances of optical fibers. Simple and precise algebraic expressions for the frequencies of high order acoustic resonances are derived, enabling a rigorous analysis of the experimental data using standard least squares fitting. Following this approach, the determination of Poisson's ratio does not require the measurement of any physical length, but only frequency measurements are required. An accuracy better than 1 â° is achieved. The dependence of the fiber Poisson's ratio with temperature is also determined experimentally.},

The GAWBS in the microtaper couples with SBS through a complex energy transfer between weak Stokes and Anti-Stokes (AS) continuous waves in the presence of a high power pulsed pump wave. This results in an amplification of Stokes wave at 7.4 GHz due to modulation of the optical fiber by GAWBS at 211 MHz generated by the pump in addition to a strong Stokes peak at 7.62 GHz and a secondary peak at 7.8 GHz that are contributed by SBS for a 2\&\#x003BC;m As\&\#x000A0;2Se\&\#x000A0;3 core radius.

The available codes for computing photonic bands are also applied to PhC waveguides. They are reliable but not very efficient, which is even more pronounced for dispersive material. We present a method based on higher order finite elements with curved cells, which allows to solve for the band structure taking directly into account the dispersiveness of the materials. This is accomplished by reformulating the wave equations as a linear eigenproblem in the complex wave-vectors k.

Photonics is demonstrated to enable a new generation of miniaturized, heterogeneous, and distributed radars, i.e., future radars on chip with different features, working in different radio spectral regions, and organized in spatially distributed sensors for the enhanced detection of a wider range of target properties. In these systems, the use of photonics assures benefits in terms of frequency flexibility, accuracy, and computational load reduction. Innovative capabilities supported by the photonic approach are presented, such as the use of coherent sparse bands for the synthesis of ultrawide bands, the use of distributed sensors for multiple-input multiple-output detections, and the use of an ultrawide band photonics-based receiver for radio frequency spectrum scanning. The presented novel concepts will open the way to new research activities both in photonic technology and radar systems, contributing to the development of a new generation of remote sensing systems. This expanding cross fertilization will lead to exciting and challenging research activities in the years to come.},

By contrast, stimulated Brillouin-scattering nonlinearities, which involve coherent coupling between guided photon and phonon modes, are stifled in conventional nanophotonics, preventing the realization of a host of Brillouin-based signal-processing technologies in silicon. Here we demonstrate stimulated Brillouin scattering in silicon waveguides, for the first time, through a new class of hybrid photonic--phononic waveguides. Tailorable travelling-wave forward-stimulated Brillouin scattering is realized---with over 1,000 times larger nonlinearity than reported in previous systems---yielding strong Brillouin coupling to phonons from 1 to 18 GHz. Experiments show that radiation pressures, produced by subwavelength modal confinement, yield enhancement of Brillouin nonlinearity beyond those of material nonlinearity alone. In addition, such enhanced and wideband coherent phonon emission paves the way towards the hybridization of silicon photonics, microelectromechanical systems and CMOS signal-processing technologies on chip.},

Based on the apparent elasticity method, the flexural vibration of a rectangular thin plate is reduced to two one-dimensional flexural vibrations of slender rods. Then the two-dimensional flexural vibration of a rectangular thin plate with free boundary conditions is considered as the coupling of these two equivalent flexural vibrations with different equivalent elastic constants. It should be noted that these two equivalent flexural vibrations are different from the traditional one-dimensional flexural vibrations of slender rods. They are coupled to each other by the introduced mechanical coupling coefficient. The analytical solutions for the isotropic rectangular thin plate in flexural vibration are derived and the resonance frequency equation is obtained. The natural vibrational mode is analyzed and the frequency spectra are calculated. It is found that the normal modes and the natural frequencies of the rectangular thin plate in flexural vibration are abundant. Theoretical analyses show that one-dimensional flexural vibration of a slender rod based on the classical elementary flexural theory, as well as the stripe mode vibration of a rectangular thin plate is a limiting vibrational mode of rectangular thin plates. Experiments show that the measured resonance frequencies are in good agreeement with the calculated results, and the displacement nodal line pattern is also observed experimentally.},

These fibers offer low propagation loss for longer lengths, high transmission rate, and high channel capacity and bandwidth. However, traditional fibers have very rigid design rules such as limited core diameter for single-mode operation and cut-off wavelengths. Photonic crystal fibers are a new class of fiber, which along with the benefits of conventional fibers provides unique properties such as endlessly single mode operation, no cut-off wavelength, and single mode operation with larger core diameters. PCFs work in two different modes: index-guiding mode and photonic bandgap mode. These fibers can be used in ophthalmology, dental imaging, military applications, and many more areas. This paper provides an overview of photonic crystal fiber and its different modes of operation and applications.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast lasers are becoming increasingly widespread in science and industry alike. Fiber-based ultrafast laser sources are especially attractive because of their compactness, alignment-free setups, and potentially low cost. However, confining short pulses within a fiber core leads to high intensities, which drives a host of nonlinear effects. While these phenomena and their interactions greatly complicate the design of such systems, they can also provide opportunities for engineering new capabilities. Here, we report a new fiber amplification regime distinguished by the use of a dynamically evolving gain spectrum as a degree of freedom: as a pulse experiences nonlinear spectral broadening, absorption and amplification actively reshape both the pulse and the gain spectrum itself. The dynamic co-evolution of the field and excited-state populations supports pulses that can broaden spectrally by almost two orders of magnitude and well beyond the gain bandwidth, while remaining cleanly compressible to their sub-50-fs transform limit. Theory and experiments provide evidence that a nonlinear attractor underlies the management of the nonlinearity by the gain. Further research into these mutual, pulse-inversion propagation dynamics may address open scientific questions and pave the way toward simple, compact fiber sources that produce high-energy, sub-30-fs pulses.},

We particularly detail the design of 6-LP-mode fibers that allow to multiply the capacity by a tenfold factor (two modes being spatially non-degenerate and four modes being two times spatially degenerate). For low-differential-mode-group-delay (low-DMGD) FMFs adapted to strongly-coupled mode-division-multiplexed systems, trench-assisted graded-index-core profiles can be optimized to have Max \${\textbackslash}vert\$ DMGD \${\textbackslash}vert\$ \&lt;10 ps/km and undesired leaky LP modes appropriately cut off, while all guided LP modes show good robustness (Bend Losses \&lt;10 dB/turn at 10 mm bend radius). Such low-DMGD FMFs being sensitive to process variability, we show how fiber concatenations can efficiently compensate for this issue and that values \&lt;25 ps/km can realistically be reached. For weakly-coupled FMFs adapted to weakly-coupled mode-division-multiplexed systems, step-index-core profiles can be optimized to have large effective index differences, \${\textbackslash}Delta n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ , between the LP modes (Min \${\textbackslash}vert\$ \${\textbackslash}Delta n\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ \${\textbackslash}vert\$ \&gt;1.0 {\texttimes} 10 \${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ ) to limit mode coupling and \$A\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ \&gt;{$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}m \${\textasciicircum}2\$ to limit intra-mode non-linearity with good mode robustness.

The interaction is applied to a Fermi's golden rule calculation of spontaneous Brillouin scattering in uniform waveguides. The Heisenberg equations of motion are then used to obtain coupled mode equations for quantised envelope operators for the optical and acoustic fields. We show that the coupling coefficients obtained coincide with those established earlier.

  abstract = {In this paper a technique to measure the distributed birefringence profile along optical fibers is proposed and experimentally validated. The method is based on the spectral correlation between two sets of orthogonally-polarized measurements acquired using a phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer (\&\#x03D5;OTDR). The correlation between the two measured spectra gives a resonance (correlation) peak at a frequency detuning that is proportional to the local refractive index difference between the two orthogonal polarization axes of the fiber. In this way the method enables local phase birefringence measurements at any position along optical fibers, so that any longitudinal fluctuation can be precisely evaluated with metric spatial resolution. The method has been experimentally validated by measuring fibers with low and high birefringence, such as standard single-mode fibers as well as conventional polarization-maintaining fibers. The technique has potential applications in the characterization of optical fibers for telecommunications as well as in distributed optical fiber sensing.},

Such filters have been implemented using fiber Bragg gratings, high-birefringence fibers and Fabry-Perot resonators.1 In all these cases, the channel spacing of the comb filter function is fixed and in the case of the fiber Bragg grating, the spectral extent is limited. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate a tunable comb filter with adjustable channel spacing with low insertion loss, large extinction ratio and can be made polarization insensitive. This filter can easily be implemented into a fiber laser configuration for multi-wavelength operation.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that although the well-known analogy between the time-independent solutions for two-dimensional tunneling (e.g., frustrated total internal reflection) and tunneling through a one-dimensional potential barrier cannot, in general, be extended to the time domain, there are certain limits in which the delay times for the two problems obey a simple relationship. In particular, when an effective mass is chosen such that mc2={$\hbar\omega$}, the ``classical'' traversal times for allowed transmission become identical for a photon of energy {$\hbar\omega$} traversing an air gap between regions of index n and for a particle of mass m traversing the analogous square barrier of height V0 in one dimension. The quantum-mechanical group delays are also identical, given this effective mass, both for EâV0 ({\texttheta}â{\texttheta}c) and for E{$\gg$}V0 ({\texttheta}{$\ll\theta$}c). (For a smoothly varying potential or index of refraction, the agreement persists for all values of E where the WKB approximation applies.) The same relation serves to equate the quantum-mechanical ``dwell'' times for any values of E and V0. On the other hand, in the ``deep tunneling'' limit, E{$\ll$}V0 ({\texttheta}â{$\pi$}/2), one must choose mc2=n2{$\hbar\omega$} in order to make the group delays equal for the two problems. These equivalences simplify certain calculations, and the two-dimensional analogy may also be useful for geometrically visualizing the tunneling process and the anomalously small group delays known to occur in the opaque limit. We also demonstrate that the equality of the group delays for transmission and reflection for lossless barriers follows from a simple intuitive argument based on time-reversal invariance, and discuss the extension of the result to the case of lossy barriers.},

The transverse vibration mode of the fiber caused by the acoustic wave can be obtained, and the principle of the optical fiber sensor to detect the acoustic wave signal was explored by using a simple model. It is found that the acoustic wave can effectively cause the change in birefringence of the fiber only when the number of azimuthal modes is 2, and the acoustic wave was detected by using a fiber sensor. It is found, by analyzing the detection mechanism, that the spectral width is proportional to the acoustic impedance of the surrounding medium, and the acoustic interaction between the TR22 mode and the surrounding medium is much weaker than that of the TR21 mode. This provides a theoretical basis for the detection of acoustic signals by fiber optic sensors.},

  abstract = {A novel wideband tunable optoelectronic oscillator based on a microwave photonic filter (MPF) with an ultra-narrow passband is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The single-passband MPF is realized by cascading an MPF based on stimulated Brillouin scattering and an infinite impulse response (IIR) MPF based on an active fiber recirculating delay loop. The measured full width at half-maximum bandwidth of the cascaded MPFs is 150\&\#x00A0;kHz. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time realizing such a narrow passband in single-passband MPF. The oscillation frequency of the OEO can be tuned from 0 to 40\&\#x00A0;GHz owing to the wideband tunability of the MPF. Thanks to the ultrahigh mode selectivity of the IIR filter, the mode hopping is successfully suppressed. A stable microwave signal at 8.18\&\#x00A0;GHz is obtained with a phase noise of \&\#x2212;113\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;dBc/Hz at 10\&\#x00A0;kHz, and the side mode noise is below \&\#x2212;95\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;dBc/Hz. The signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 50\&\#x00A0;dB during the tuning process.},

Matrix elements giving the strength of coupling between guided modes at a corner bend, and for coupling between guided modes and radiation modes, are calculated as a function of guiding strength for this "geometrical" effect. The correction to these matrix elements due to the longitudinal strain in a bent fiber is also determined. The increase in propagation constant for the fundamental mode of a fiber wrapped in a coil of constant radius is calculated from information on the coupling strengths and mode propagation constants. The phase shift and attenuation of the fundamental mode caused by a spatially periodic microbending of the fiber axis are also considered. Finally, potential applications of these effects in fiber-optic devices such as mode converters, phase shifters, switches, and sensors are discussed.},

These include light modulation by thermally excited rod modes in an optical fiber, Brillouin gain measurements in fibers that are both acoustically and optically guiding, and some optical communication applications of stimulated Brillouin scattering.

A global description of pattern formation in both monostable and bistable regimes is given. We show that the interaction between the modulational modes and the zero mode modifies the existence and the stability of diffractive patterns. In particular, this interaction induces a coexistence between two different types of phase locked hexagonal structures. We also consider the interaction between two separated LSs. An analytical expression for the interaction potential in terms of modified Bessel functions is derived. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical predictions.},

We use a two-step drawing process to fabricate long free-standing silica wires with diameters down to 50\,nm that show surface smoothness at the atomic level together with uniformity of diameter. Light can be launched into these wires by optical evanescent coupling. The wires allow single-mode operation, and have an optical loss of less than 0.1\,dB\,mm-1.

Most efforts have centred on coupling light to motion in a high-quality optical cavity, typically geared towards manipulating the quantum state of a mechanical oscillator. It was recently predicted that the strength of the light--sound interaction would increase drastically in nanoscale silicon photonic wires. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such a giant overlap between near-infrared light and gigahertz sound co-localized in a small-core silicon wire. The wire is supported by a tiny pillar to block the path for external phonon leakage, trapping 10\>GHz phonons in an area of less than 0.1\>{$\mu$}m2. Because our geometry can also be studied in microcavities, it paves the way for complete fusion between the fields of cavity optomechanics and Brillouin scattering. The results bode well for the realization of optically driven lasers/sasers, isolators and comb generators on a densely integrated silicon chip.},

This begs for the development of a broader theory that contains both fields. Here, we derive the dynamics of optomechanical cavities from that of Brillouin-active waveguides. This explicit transition elucidates the link between phenomena such as Brillouin amplification and electromagnetically induced transparency. It proves that effects familiar from cavity optomechanics all have traveling-wave partners, but not vice versa. We reveal a close connection between two parameters of central importance in these fields: the Brillouin gain coefficient and the zero-point optomechanical coupling rate. This enables comparisons between systems as diverse as ultracold atom clouds, plasmonic Raman cavities, and nanoscale silicon waveguides. In addition, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that unobserved effects, such as photon-assisted amplification of traveling phonons, are now accessible in existing systems. Finally, we formulate both circuit- and cavity-oriented optomechanics in terms of vacuum coupling rates, cooperativities, and gain coefficients, thus reflecting the similarities in the underlying physics.},

It is able to predict dispersion curves, high and low loss spectral regions, and the conditions to ensure the existence of low loss regions. In addition, it allows a better understanding of the role of the geometrical parameters and of the dielectric refractive index. The model is then applied to improve the tradeoff between low loss and effectively single mode propagation, showing that the best results are obtained with a heptagonal arrangement of the tubes.},

It took researchers nearly two decades for conceiving the structure of single-ring hollow-core negative curvature fiber (NCF). Recently NCF eventually approaches to the centre of intense study in fiber optics. The reason behind this slow-pace development is, undoubtfully, its inexplicit guidance mechanism. This paper aims at gaining a clear physical insight into the optical guidance mechanism in NCF. To clarify the origins of light confinement, we boldly disassemble the NCF structure into several layers and develop a multi-layered model. Four physical origins, namely single-path Fresnel transmission through cascaded interfaces, near-grazing incidence, multi-path interference caused by Fresnel reflection, and glass wall shape are revealed and their individual contributions are quantified for the first time. Such an elegant model could not only elucidate the optical guidance in existing types of hollow-core fibers but also assist in design of novel structure for new functions.},

The slot waveguide can intensify radiation pressure close to the slot and simultaneously confine both optical and acoustic modes, resulting in an enhanced FSBS gain on the order of 300 W-1m-1. The acoustic radiation loss is significantly suppressed due to the strong acoustic coupling in the narrow slot waveguides. We analyze the impacts of structural parameters on the SBS properties, which produces the optimal parameters for maximum SBS gain. Based on the nonlinear coupled-mode equations, we compare the performance of Stokes amplification between the Si3N4 slot waveguides and the silicon nanowires. Simulation results indicate that the Si3N4 slot waveguides with low linear loss can offer a larger net Stokes amplification than silicon waveguides under moderate pump power. Such approach enables efficient on-chip SBS devices in CMOS-compatible Si3N4 platform.},

The tight confinement of the light and acoustic field enhances the interaction and results in a large gain coefficient of 34.7 W-1 at a frequency of 933.8 MHz. We also find that the profile on the anti-Stokes side of the pump beam have lineshapes that are asymmetric, which we show is due to the interference between FSBS and the optical Kerr effect. The measured FSBS resonance linewidths are found to increase linearly with the acoustic frequency. Based on this scaling, we conclude that dominant contribution to the linewidth is from surface damping due to the fiber jacket and structural nonuniformities along the fiber.},

We have experimentally demonstrated simultaneous photon and phonon lasing in a two-mode silica fiber ring cavity via forward intermodal stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) mediated by long-lived flexural acoustic waves. This two-domain laser may find potential applications in optical/acoustic tweezers, optomechanical sensing, microwave generation, and quantum information processing.

In order to strip the power of cladding light uniformly over the length of the fiber, a method corroding the inner cladding layer to special shape is proposed. The Monte Carlo algorithm is used to simulate the performance of this method. The results show that it has the attenuation ability of 26dB and can strip the cladding light uniformly without making local temperature too high.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a nonlinear silicon nitride waveguide. These waveguide are fabricated by readily available PECVD, conventional contact UV-lithography and high-temperature annealing techniques, thus dramatically reducing the processing complexity and cost. By patterning the waveguide structures firstly and then carrying out a high-temperature annealing process, not only sufficient waveguide thickness can be achieved, which gives more freedom to waveguide dispersion control, but also the material absorption loss in the waveguides be greatly reduced. The linear optical loss of the fabricated waveguide with a cross-section of 2.0 \&\#x00D7; 0.58 \&\#x00B5;m2 was measured to be as low as 0.58 dB/cm. The same loss level is demonstrated over a broad wavelength range from 1500 nm to 1630 nm. Moreover, the nonlinear refractive index of the waveguide was determined to be {\textasciitilde}6.94 \&\#x00D7; 10\&\#x2212;19 m2/W, indicating that comparable nonlinear performance with their LPCVD counterparts is expected. These silicon nitride waveguides based on a PECVD deposition platform can be useful for the development of more complicated on-chip nonlinear optical devices or circuits.},

During the draw, the shape of the holes are manipulated so that the final fiber design approximates that of an air-suspended rod with three fine struts supporting the core. Modeling reveals that the modal overlap is greater than 29\% at 1550 nm for a core diameter of 0.8 {\textmu}m, which is significantly higher than any previously reported index-guiding structure used for sensing. A basic gas sensor is demonstrated using acetylene as the sensing medium and the results are reported.},

  abstract = {The ability to strip cladding light from double clad fiber (DCF) fibers is required for many different reasons, one example is to strip unwanted cladding light in fiber lasers and amplifiers. When removing residual pump light for example, this light is characterized by a large numerical aperture distribution and can reach power levels into the hundreds of watts. By locally changing the numerical aperture (N.A.) of the light to be stripped, it is possible to achieve significant attenuation even for the low N.A. rays such as escaped core modes in the same device. In order to test the power-handling capability of this device, one hundred watts of pump and signal light is launched from a tapered fusedbundle (TFB) 6+1x1 combiner into a high power-cladding stripper. In this case, the fiber used in the cladding stripper and the output fiber of the TFB was a 20/400 0.06/0.46 N.A. double clad fiber. Attenuation of over 20dB in the cladding was measured without signal loss. By spreading out the heat load generated by the unwanted light that is stripped, the package remained safely below the maximum operating temperature internally and externally. This is achieved by uniformly stripping the energy along the length of the fiber within the stripper. Different adhesive and heat sinking techniques are used to achieve this uniform removal of the light. This suggests that these cladding strippers can be used to strip hundreds of watts of light in high power fiber lasers and amplifiers.},

In the context of integrated photonics, two topics with dissimilar origins---cavity optomechanics and guided wave Brillouin scattering---are rooted in the manipulation and control of the energy exchange between trapped light and mechanical modes. In this tutorial, we explore the impact of optical and mechanical subwavelength confinement on the interaction among these waves, coined as Brillouin optomechanics. At this spatial scale, optical and mechanical fields are fully vectorial and the common intuition that more intense fields lead to stronger interaction may fail. Here, we provide a thorough discussion on how the two major physical effects responsible for the Brillouin interaction---photoelastic and moving-boundary effects---interplay to foster exciting possibilities in this field. In order to stimulate beginners into this growing research field, this tutorial is accompanied by all the discussed simulation material based on a widespread commercial finite-element solver.},

When the gain is strong enough that the gain length becomes comparable to the acoustic wave decay length of order 100 microns, standard approximations treating the acoustic field as a local response no longer apply. Treating the acoustic evolution more accurately, we find that the backward SBS gain of sub-millimetre long waveguides is significantly reduced from the value obtained by the conventional treatment because the acoustic mode requires several decay lengths to build up to its nominal value. In addition, the corresponding resonance line is broadened with the development of side bands. In contrast, we argue that intra-mode forward SBS is not expected to show these effects. Our results have implications for several recent proposals and experiments on high-gain stimulated Brillouin scattering in short semiconductor waveguides.},

  abstract = {We study the impact of structural variations (that is slowly varying geometry aberrations and internal strain fields) on the width and shape of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) resonance in nanoscale waveguides. We find that they lead to an inhomogeneous resonance broadening through two distinct mechanisms: firstly, the acoustic frequency is directly influenced via mechanical nonlinearities; secondly, the optical wave numbers are influenced via the opto-mechanical nonlinearity leading to an additional acoustic frequency shift via the phase-matching condition. We find that this second mechanism is proportional to the opto-mechanical coupling and, hence, related to the SBS-gain itself. It is absent in intra-mode forward SBS, while it plays a significant role in backward scattering. In backward SBS increasing the opto-acoustic overlap beyond a threshold defined by the fabrication tolerances will therefore no longer yield the expected quadratic increase in overall Stokes amplification. Finally, we illustrate in a numerical example that in backward SBS and inter-mode forward SBS the existence of two broadening mechanisms with opposite sign also opens the possibility to compensate the effect of geometry-induced broadening. Our results can be transferred to other micro- and nano-structured waveguide geometries such as photonic crystal fibres.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical studies of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in nanoscale devices have led to intense research effort dedicated to the demonstration and application of this nonlinearity in on-chip systems. The key feature of SBS in integrated photonic waveguides is that small, high-contrast waveguides are predicted to experience powerful optical forces on the waveguide boundaries, which are predicted to further boost the SBS gain that is already expected to grow dramatically in such structures because of the higher mode confinement alone. In all recent treatments, the effect of radiation pressure is included separately from the scattering action that the acoustic field exerts on the optical field. In contrast to this, we show here that the effects of radiation pressure and motion of the waveguide boundaries are inextricably linked. Central to this insight is a new formulation of the SBS interaction that unifies the treatment of light and sound, incorporating all relevant interaction mechanisms---radiation pressure, waveguide boundary motion, electrostriction, and photoelasticity---from a rigorous thermodynamic perspective. Our approach also clarifies important points of ambiguity in the literature, such as the nature of edge effects with regard to electrostriction and of body forces with respect to radiation pressure. This new perspective on Brillouin processes leads to physical insight with implications for the design and fabrication of SBS-based nanoscale devices.},

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive numerical and experimental study of chip-based Brillouin MWP bandpass filters implemented in a range of link configurations. In the experiments, key RF performance figures of merit, including link gain, noise figure, passband resolution, bandwidth tunability, and passband extinction of chip-based Brillouin filters are experimentally investigated and numerically analyzed. This comprehensive study points out a preferable filter scheme with optimized system-level performance.

However, the diffraction nature of light has limited the scalability of many atom-light--based quantum systems. We use the optical fields in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber to spatially split, reflect, and recombine a coherent superposition state of free-falling 85Rb atoms to realize an inertia-sensitive atom interferometer. The interferometer operates over a diffraction-free distance, and the contrasts and phase shifts at different distances agree within one standard error. The integration of phase coherent photonic and quantum systems here shows great promise to advance the capability of atom interferometers in the field of precision measurement and quantum sensing with miniature design of apparatus and high efficiency of laser power consumption.

Experiments with an air-clad elliptical fiber with a major diameter of 0.9{$\mu$}m and a minor/major diameter ratio of 0.9 demonstrated a group birefringence of {\textasciitilde} 0.015, agreeing well with the theoretical predictions.

The ultra-narrow bandwidth of the MPF is implemented by a Brillouin laser resonator, which is composed of a cascaded ring Fabry--P{\'e}rot (CR-FP) resonator formed by a main cavity with a cavity length of 100~m and a secondary cavity with a cavity length of 10~m. A Brillouin laser resonator is formed by the main cavity to obtain an extremely narrow comb-shaped Brillouin gain spectrum. The Vernier effect of the double ring cavity can effectively suppress the side modes, thereby realizing the narrow linewidth Brillouin laser filtering. Besides, two identical tunable lasers provide the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) pump light and optical carrier signal for this device respectively. After the interaction between the Brillouin gain spectrum and the optical modulation signal, the filter passband can be stably tuned by simply changing the wavelength of SBS pump light. The experimental results show that the microwave photonic filter can be stably tuned in the frequency range of 0--20~GHz, the out-of-band rejection ratio is about 20~dB, and the minimum 3~dB bandwidth is about 114 Hz.},

  abstract = {Using multimode fibers for long-haul transmission is proposed and demonstrated experimentally. In particular few-mode fibers (FMFs) are demonstrated as a good compromise since they are sufficiently resistant to mode coupling compared to standard multimode fibers but they still can have large core diameters compared to single-mode fibers. As a result these fibers can have significantly less nonlinearity and at the same time they can have the same performance as single-mode fibers in terms of dispersion and loss. In the absence of mode coupling it is possible to use these fibers in the single-mode operation where all the data is carried in only one of the spatial modes throughout the fiber. It is shown experimentally that the single-mode operation is achieved simply by splicing single-mode fibers to both ends of a 35-km-long dual-mode fiber at 1310 nm. After 35 km of transmission, no modal dispersion or excess loss was observed. Finally the same fiber is placed in a recirculating loop and 3 WDM channels each carrying 6 Gb/s BPSK data were transmitted through1050 km of the few-mode fiber without modal dispersion.},

The measurement error can be less than 0.001 mm with 1 pm wavelength precision and 0.1 mm fiber length precision. With a high performance wavelength interrogator technology and a special designed fiber length measurement method, a beat length measurement setup was built and the measurement standard deviation of 3.08 {\texttimes} 10-4 mm was achieved with 250 measurement samples for solid core polarization maintaining photonic crystal fibers (PM-PCFs).

In the incoherent regime, a delay-line configuration is usually used with a finite-impulse response (FIR) or infinite-impulse response (IIR); to avoid optical interference, an incoherence light source or a laser array is used. Filter tuning and reconfiguration are achieved by changing the time delay and the tap coefficients. In the coherent regime, however, a single wavelength is needed, and the filter's spectral response is translated directly from the spectral response of an optical filter. Thus, a coherent microwave filter requires a well-defined optical filter with a precisely controlled spectral response. This article reviews the techniques for implementing both incoherent and coherent tunable and reconfigurable microwave photonic filters.},

  abstract = {Optical fibers are an excellent sensor platform. However, the detection and analysis of media outside the cladding and coating of standard fibers represent a long-standing challenge: light that is guided in the single optical core mode does not reach these media. Cladding modes help work around this difficulty, as their transverse profiles span the entire cross-section of the fiber cladding and reach its outer boundary. In this tutorial, we introduce and discuss in detail two recent advances in optical fiber sensors that make use of cladding modes. Both concepts share optomechanics as a common underlying theme. First, we describe a spatially continuous distributed analysis using the optical cladding modes of the fiber. Light is coupled to these modes using Brillouin dynamic gratings, which are index perturbations associated with acoustic waves in the core that are stimulated by light. Unlike permanent gratings, which are routinely used to couple light with cladding modes, Brillouin dynamic gratings may be switched on and off at will and can be confined to short fiber sections at arbitrary locations in a random-access manner. Second, we present the extension of the cladding mode sensor concept to include acoustic rather than optical modes. The acoustic cladding modes may be stimulated and monitored by guided light in the single core mode, and their linewidths are modified by the elastic properties of surrounding media. The principles and analyses of both concepts are provided in detail, alongside examples of experimental setups and results.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a compilation of important review in the development of microwave filters for wideband technology used in previous years. The major research work for each year is reviewed. Several wideband filters based on the planar and non-planar circuits are compared and examined in order to propose a new topology of wideband filter using Suspended Stripline Structure (SSS). More importantly, this new proposed structure will be integrated with the Defects Ground Structure (DGS) to form an advanced hybrid system for wideband applications. This system will produce the band-pass and band-stop responses simultaneously in order to discriminate between the desired and undesired signals in the wideband spectrum. The proposed system outlined in this paper, featuring new innovation in hybrid structure as well as providing an insight of the direction of future research works. The contribution of this study is useful for applications where the reduction of physical volume is very important, while maintaining its good performance such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB), commercial radar as well as the wideband warfare receiver. As for future works, integration techniques between the UWB filter and DGS will be designed and analyzed to form an advanced new microwave device in order to produce bandpass and bandreject response in the same structure simultaneously.},

The on-chip MPF consists of a high-speed phase modulator (PM), a thermally tunable high-Q micro-disk resonator (MDR), and a high-speed photodetector (PD). The filtering function of the MPF is realized based on phase modulation and phase modulation to intensity modulation conversion, to translate the spectral response of the MDR in the optical domain to the spectral response of the MPF in the microwave domain. The tunability of the MPF is realized by thermally tuning the MDR. The proposed on-chip bandpass MPF is fabricated and characterized. An MPF with a passband of 1.93\&\#x00A0;GHz and a tunable range from 3 to 10\&\#x00A0;GHz is demonstrated. The power consumption, the insertion loss, and the bandwidth over the entire tunable range are studied. This successful implementation of an MPF marks a significant step forward in the full integration of microwave photonic systems on a single chip.},

When uniform axial strain is applied to fiber, the core, and inner and outer cladding become uniaxial crystal optically; that is, the optical axes are parallel to the fiber's axis. Analytic expressions of the strain sensitivities of LPFGs are derived.

Based on mode confinement factor, a criterion for selecting the fundamental mode was proposed. Theoretical analysis has shown that the integral coefficient of 0.5 could effectively distinguish fundamental modes from high-ordered ones.

Switching of the filter function is simply and conveniently obtained by changing the dc bias to the DDMZM. In addition, the center frequency of the switchable filter can be tuned over a wide frequency range. A detailed analysis and simulation of the DDMZM operation in conjunction with the SBS technique is presented in order to obtain the required optimum bias conditions for the DDMZM for realizing the switching action between the single-bandpass filter and the notch filter and also to select the optimum pump power for the SBS operation. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of this structure to switch between a high-resolution bandpass filter and a high-resolution notch filter, with Q values around 400--500, and the ability to operate over a frequency range of 2--20 GHz.},

Besides, an RF rejection ratio exceeding 50 dB was achieved for a microring resonator with an optical extinction ratio of only 4 dB, where a 46-dB enhancement from optical to RF response is obtained. Also, the bandwidth of the microwave photonic filter can tuned from 0.65 to 2.2 GHz by adjusting the coupling ratio of the ring resonator. Meanwhile, by tuning the wavelength of the optical carrier, the filtering frequency can be tuned and a tuning range of about 25 GHz was achieved. The implementation is much simpler and more economical compared with previous reports and has great potential in monolithic integration of microwave photonic filters on chip.},

We compare the noise spectrum to the one of a standard fiber and find an increase of noise even though the light is mainly transmitted in air in a hollow-core PCF. Combined with our simulation of the acoustic vibrational modes in the hollow-core PCF, we are offering an explanation for the polarization noise with a variation of guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS). Here, instead of modulating the strain in the fiber core as in a solid core fiber, the acoustic vibrations in hollow-core PCF influence the effective refractive index by modulating the geometry of the photonic crystal structure. This induces polarization noise in the light guided by the photonic crystal structure.},

  abstract = {Microwave photonics is a promising and rapidly developing interdisciplinary field. It combines microwave and photonic techniques to generate, transmit, process, and manipulate microwave signals by using the advantages of broadband, high frequency, and low loss provided by photonics. As an important branch of microwave photonics, the microwave photonic filter (MPF) can overcome the limitations set by traditional electronic technology and can realize advanced signal processing in modern communication systems due to its higher performance, selectivity, and flexibility. This review provides a comprehensive overview of MPFs, including fundamental principles, typical structures, and key applications. Additionally, the microwave photonic integration is a very important tendence because of its advantages of small size, light weight, low power consumption, and low cost. The recent advances in integrated MPF are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate slow light via stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in a room temperature  optical fiber that is pumped by a spectrally broadened laser. Broadening the spectrum of the pump field increases  the linewidth \&\#x0394;\&\#x03C9;P of the Stokes amplifying  resonance, thereby increasing the slow-light bandwidth. One physical bandwidth limitation occurs when the linewidth  becomes several times larger than the Brillouin frequency shift \&\#x03A9;B so that the anti-Stokes absorbing resonance substantially cancels out the Stokes amplifying resonance  and, hence, the slow-light effect. We find that partial overlap of the Stokes and anti-Stokes resonances can  actually lead to an enhancement of the slow-light delay-bandwidth product when \&\#x0394;\&\#x03C9;P {\textasciitilde} or = 1.3 \&\#x03A9;B. Using this general approach, we increase the Brillouin  slow-light bandwidth to over 12 GHz from its nominal linewidth of {\textasciitilde}30 MHz obtained for monochromatic pumping. We controllably delay 75-ps-long pulses by up to 47 ps and  study the data-pattern dependence of the broadband SBS slow-light system.},

We form a composite Bragg reflector with a micronscale period by dissolving aluminum coating, slicing the grating along ruling lines, and mounting it on an ONF. The resonant wavelengths of high-order Bragg reflections possess fiber diameter dependence, enabling nondestructive measurement of the ONF diameter profile. This method provides an easy and economic diagnostic tool for wide varieties of ONF-based applications.},

Experimental results show that the linewidth of STRS and spontaneous Rayleigh scattering are {\textasciitilde}9 kHz, {\textasciitilde}10 kHz, and {\textasciitilde}11 kHz, and {\textasciitilde}25 kHz, {\textasciitilde}30 kHz, and {\textasciitilde}27 kHz for SMF-28e, LEAF and PMF, respectively. The threshold power for STRS for 2km SMF-28e, 7km LEAF, and 100m PMF are 11dBm, 4.5dBm and 16.5dBm, respectively. The measured Rayleigh gain coefficient is a 2 {\texttimes} 10-13 m/W for SMF-28e. Also, weak frequency shift could be observed when input power is large enough before SBS occurred. Because of the properties of narrower bandwidth and lower threshold power of STRS in fibers, some of applications, such as narrower filter, could be realized.},
